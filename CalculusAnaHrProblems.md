3.  If $0 \le k \le n$, the “binomial coefficient" $\binom{n}{k}$ is defined by
    $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} = \frac{n(n - 1)...(n - k + 1)}{k!}$ if $k \ne 0, n$
    $\binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n} = 1$ (a special case of the first formula if we define 0! = 1),
    and for $k < 0$ or $k > n$ we just define the binomial coefficient to be 0.
    (a) Prove that $\binom{n+1}{k} = \binom{n}{k-1} + \binom{n}{k}$.
    (The proof does not require an induction argument.)
    (b) Notice that all the numbers in Pascal's triangle are natural numbers. Use part (a) to prove by induction that $\binom{n}{k}$ is always a natural number.
    (c) Give another proof that $\binom{n}{k}$ is a natural number by showing that $\binom{n}{k}$ is the number of sets of exactly k integers each chosen from 1, ..., n.
    (d) Prove the “binomial theorem”: If a and b are any numbers and n is a natural number, then
    $(a + b)^n = a^n + \binom{n}{1}a^{n-1}b + \binom{n}{2}a^{n-2}b^2 + ... + \binom{n}{n-1}ab^{n-1} + b^n = \sum_{j=0}^{n} \binom{n}{j}a^{n-j}b^j$.
    (e) Prove that
    (i) $\sum_{j=0}^{n} \binom{n}{j} = \binom{n}{0} + ... + \binom{n}{n} = 2^n$.
    (ii) $\sum_{j=0}^{n} (-1)^j \binom{n}{j} = \binom{n}{0} - \binom{n}{1} + ... \pm \binom{n}{n} = 0$.
    (iii) $\sum_{l \text{ odd}} \binom{n}{l} = \binom{n}{1} + \binom{n}{3} + ... = 2^{n-1}$.
    (iv) $\sum_{l \text{ even}} \binom{n}{l} = \binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{2} + ... = 2^{n-1}$.

4.  (a) Prove that $\sum_{k=0}^{l} \binom{n}{k}\binom{m}{l-k} = \binom{n+m}{l}$. Hint: Apply the binomial theorem to $(1 + x)^n (1 + x)^m$.
    (b) Prove that $\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k}^2 = \binom{2n}{n}$.

5.  (a) Prove by induction on n that $1 + r + r^2 + ... + r^n = \frac{1 - r^{n+1}}{1 - r}$ if $r \ne 1$.
    (b) Derive this result by setting $S = 1 + r + ... + r^n$, multiplying this equation by r, and solving the two equations for S.

6.  The formula for $1^2 + ... + n^2$ may be derived as follows. We begin with the formula $(k + 1)^3 - k^3 = 3k^2 + 3k + 1$. Writing this formula for k = 1, ..., n and adding, we obtain
    $2^3 - 1^3 = 3 \cdot 1^2 + 3 \cdot 1 + 1$
    $3^3 - 2^3 = 3 \cdot 2^2 + 3 \cdot 2 + 1$
    ...
    $(n + 1)^3 - n^3 = 3 \cdot n^2 + 3 \cdot n + 1$
    $(n + 1)^3 - 1 = 3[1^2 + ... + n^2] + 3[1 + ... + n] + n$.
    Thus we can find $\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2$ if we already know $\sum_{k=1}^{n} k$. Use this method to find
    (i) $1^3 + ... + n^3$.
    (ii) $1^4 + ... + n^4$.
    (iii) $\frac{1}{1\cdot 2} + \frac{1}{2\cdot 3} + ... + \frac{1}{n(n+1)}$.
    (iv) $\frac{3}{1^2\cdot 2^2} + \frac{5}{2^2\cdot 3^2} + ... + \frac{2n+1}{n^2(n+1)^2}$.

7.  Use the method of Problem 6 to show that $\sum_{i=1}^{n} k^p$ can always be written in the form $\frac{n^{p+1}}{p+1} + An^p + Bn^{p-1} + Cn^{p-2} + ...$.

### Chapter 4: GRAPHS - Problems

1.  Indicate on a straight line the set of all x satisfying the following conditions. Also name each set, using the notation for intervals (in some cases you will also need the U sign).

7.  (a) For any numbers A, B, and C, with A and B not both 0, show that the set of all (x, y) satisfying $Ax + By + C = 0$ is a straight line (possibly a vertical one). Hint: First decide when a vertical straight line is described.
    (b) Show conversely that every straight line, including vertical ones, can be described as the set of all (x, y) satisfying $Ax + By + C = 0$.

8.  (a) Prove that the graphs of the functions $f(x) = mx + b$, $g(x) = nx + c$, are perpendicular if $mn = -1$.

10. Sketch the graphs of the following functions, plotting enough points to get a good idea of the general appearance.
    (i) $f(x) = x + 1/x$. (What happens for x near 0, and for large x? Where does the graph lie in relation to the graph of the identity function? Why does it suffice to consider only positive x at first?)

12. Graph the functions $f(x) = \sqrt[m]{x}$ for m = 1, 2, 3, 4. (There is an easy way to do this, using Figure 14 from OCR. Be sure to remember, however, that $\sqrt[m]{x}$ means the positive mth root of x when m is even; you should also note that there will be an important difference between the graphs when m is even and when m is odd.)

13. (a) Graph $f(x) = |x|$ and $f(x) = x^2$.
    (b) Graph $f(x) = |\sin x|$ and $f(x) = \sin^2 x$.

14. Describe the graph of g in terms of the graph of f if
