# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physics
## Problem Set
1. A car accelerates uniformly from rest to a speed of 20 m/s over a distance of 100 m. Calculate its acceleration.
   - Type: Numerical
   - Difficulty: Medium
   - Topics: Kinematics, Uniform Acceleration
   - Answer: Using v²=u²+2as, where u=0, v=20m/s, s=100m: a=2.0 m/s²

2. Explain why a ball thrown vertically upward takes the same time to go up as to come down, neglecting air resistance.
   - Type: Conceptual
   - Difficulty: Easy
   - Topics: Projectile Motion, Gravity
   - Answer: Due to symmetry of motion under constant acceleration, time up equals time down.

# Chapter 2: Forces and Motion
## Problem Set
1. A 2 kg mass is pulled across a rough surface by a horizontal force of 10 N. If the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.3, calculate the acceleration of the mass.
   - Type: Numerical
   - Difficulty: Medium
   - Topics: Forces, Friction, Newton's Laws
   - Answer: Using F=ma and considering friction force: a=(10-0.3×2×9.81)/2 = 3.53 m/s²

2. Why does a person feel weightless in a freely falling elevator?
   - Type: Conceptual
   - Difficulty: Easy
   - Topics: Free Fall, Apparent Weight
   - Answer: In free fall, normal force becomes zero as both person and elevator accelerate at g.
