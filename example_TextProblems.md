        2.  Substitute given values.
        3.  Perform calculations.
        4.  State the final answer with units.
    *   **Expected Answer:** [Detailed answer, e.g., 25 N]
    *   **Keywords:** Calculation, Derivation, Foundational
    *   **Difficulty:** Easy
    *   **Textbook Page Reference (Optional):** 40

2.  **Problem Statement:** Explain the difference between [Concept X] and [Concept Y] using a specific example for each.
    *   **Solution Approach:**
        1.  Define Concept X with its key characteristics.
        2.  Provide a clear example of Concept X.
        3.  Define Concept Y with its key characteristics.
        4.  Provide a clear example of Concept Y.
        5.  Highlight the main distinctions.

## Section 2: Advanced Application Problems

3.  **Problem Statement:** Design a system that achieves [Objective Z] under the constraints of [Constraint 1] and [Constraint 2]. Justify your design choices and discuss potential trade-offs.
    *   **Solution Approach:**
        1.  Understand the objective and constraints.
        2.  Propose a system design (diagrams can be described textually, e.g., "[A block diagram showing components A, B, and C connected in series]").
        3.  Justify component choices and overall architecture based on principles from the chapter.
        4.  Analyze trade-offs (e.g., cost vs. performance).
    *   **Expected Answer:** [Comprehensive design document, justification, and trade-off analysis]
    *   **Keywords:** System Design, Application, Trade-offs, Advanced
    *   **Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Textbook Page Reference (Optional):** 112-120

**Note on Equations:**
Represent equations in LaTeX format where possible:
`$$\oint E \cdot dA = \frac{Q_{enc}}{\varepsilon_0}$$`
Or use clear textual descriptions.

**Note on Diagrams/Sketches:**
If a problem requires a diagram for its solution, describe what the diagram should illustrate:
"Sketch a free-body diagram for the object, showing forces F1, F2, and Fg."
The actual drawing is not expected in this Markdown.
