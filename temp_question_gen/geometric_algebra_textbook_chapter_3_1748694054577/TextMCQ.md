    *   (C) `$$R(t) = R_0 \exp(-\frac{1}{2} \Omega_l t) \exp(-\frac{1}{2} \Omega_r t)$$`
    *   (D) `$$\dot{R} = -\frac{1}{2} \Omega_l R - \frac{1}{2} R \Omega_r$$`
    *   **Answer:** (B)
    *   **Explanation:** Equation (3.162) directly provides the integrated solution as `R(t) = exp(−1/2 Ωl t)R0 exp(−1/2 Ωr t)`. Option (D) is the differential form of the rotor equation (3.161).

7.  **Question Text:** What physical phenomenon is the 'internal' rotation in the `e1e2` plane of a symmetric top, as described by the solution `R(t)`, responsible for?
    *   (A) The nutation of the top.
    *   (B) The constant angular momentum of the top.
    *   (C) The precession of the symmetric top.
    *   (D) The oscillation of the top's spin axis.
    *   **Answer:** (C)
    *   **Explanation:** The text states, "It shows that there is an ‘internal’ rotation in the `e1e2` plane (the symmetry plane of the body). This is responsible for the precession of a symmetric top."
