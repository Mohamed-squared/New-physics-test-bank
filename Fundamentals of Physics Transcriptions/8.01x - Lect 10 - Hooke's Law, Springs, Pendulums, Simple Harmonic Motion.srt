00:00:00,687 --> 00:07,997
Today we're going to talk about springs, about pendulums and about simple harmonic oscillators.

2
00:08,227 --> 00:11,557
One of the key topics in 801.

3
00:12,517 --> 00:16,177
If I have a spring,

4
00:17,157 --> 00:20,567
and this is the relaxed length of the string, spring.

5
00:21,037 --> 00:23,087
I call that x = 0.

6
00:23,817 --> 00:27,927
And I extend the string, the spring with a P.

7
00:28,337 --> 00:35,407
Then there is a force that wants to drive this spring back to equilibrium.

8
00:36,157 --> 00:42,507
And it is an experimental fact that many springs, we call them ideal springs,

9
00:43,097 --> 00:49,507
for many springs, this force is proportional to the displacement X.

10
00:50,377 --> 00:52,037
So if this is X,

11
00:53,167 --> 00:58,657
If you make X three times larger, that restoring force is three times larger.

12
00:59,867 --> 01:11,117
This is a one-dimensional problem, so to avoid the vector notation, we can simply say that the force, therefore, is minus a certain constant, which we call the spring constant.

13
01:11,447 --> 01:13,447
This is called the spring constant.

14
01:14,397 --> 01:18,097
And the spring constant has units Newtons per meter.

15
01:18,907 --> 01:22,267
So the minus sign takes care of the direction.

16
01:22,727 --> 01:30,027
When X is positive, then the force is in the negative direction. When F is negative, the force is in the positive direction.

17
01:30,747 --> 01:32,507
It is a restoring force.

18
01:33,477 --> 01:42,187
Whenever this linear relation between F and X holds, that is referred to as Hook's law.

19
01:44,047 --> 01:47,567
How can we measure the spring constant?

20
01:48,197 --> 01:50,317
That's actually not too difficult.

21
01:50,997 --> 01:57,947
I can use gravity. Here is the spring in its relaxed situation.

22
01:58,317 --> 02:07,237
I hang on the spring a mass M, and I make use of the fact that gravity now exerts a force on the spring,

23
02:07,747 --> 02:16,457
and when you have a new equilibrium, this is the new equilibrium position, then the spring force, of course, must be exactly the same as mg.

24
02:16,757 --> 02:19,667
There's no acceleration when the thing is at rest.

25
02:19,897 --> 02:28,777
And so I could now make a plot whereby I could have here X, and I could have here this force F, which I know because I know the masses.

26
02:29,357 --> 02:33,317
I can change the masses, I can go through a whole lot of them.

27
02:33,757 --> 02:38,537
And you will see data points which scatter around a straight line.

28
02:39,637 --> 02:50,117
And the spring constant follows then if you take, if you call this delta F, and you call this delta X,

29
02:50,797 --> 02:56,427
then the spring constant K is delta F divided by delta X.

30
02:56,617 --> 03:02,417
So you can even measure it, you don't have to start necessarily at this point where the spring is relaxed.

31
03:02,647 --> 03:06,407
You could already start when the spring is already under tension.

32
03:06,607 --> 03:08,667
That is not a problem.

33
03:10,567 --> 03:16,477
You'd be surprised how many springs really behave very nicely according to Hook's law.

34
03:17,367 --> 03:27,547
Uh, I have one here. That's not a very expensive spring. You see it here, and there is here holder onto it, so it's already a little bit under stress.

35
03:27,957 --> 03:29,367
That doesn't make any difference.

36
03:30,237 --> 03:33,127
These marks here are 13 cm apart.

37
03:33,427 --> 03:39,537
And every time that I put 1 kg on, you will see that it goes down by roughly 13 cm.

38
03:40,327 --> 03:42,057
It goes down to this mark.

39
03:42,637 --> 03:46,307
I put another kilogram on, goes down to this mark.

40
03:47,437 --> 03:52,097
I put another kilogram on and it goes back to this mark.

41
03:53,117 --> 03:54,177
All the way down.

42
03:54,527 --> 03:58,537
And if I take them all off, so what I've done is I effectively went along this curve.

43
03:58,837 --> 04:05,147
And if I take them off, if it is an ideal spring, then it goes back to its original length.

44
04:06,447 --> 04:07,397
And which it does.

45
04:07,837 --> 04:12,667
That's a requirement, of course, for an ideal spring, if it behaves according to Hook's law.

46
04:13,537 --> 04:16,107
Now, I can of course overdo things.

47
04:16,537 --> 04:22,637
I can take a spring like this one and stretch it to the point that it no longer behaves like Hook's law.

48
04:23,207 --> 04:24,637
I can damage it.

49
04:25,477 --> 04:29,127
Uh, I can do permanent deformation.

50
04:29,887 --> 04:35,447
Look, that's easy. For sure Hook's law is no longer acting.

51
04:35,717 --> 04:38,237
Look how much longer this spring is than it was before.

52
04:38,657 --> 04:45,237
So there comes of course a limit how far you can go before you permanently deform the spring.

53
04:45,697 --> 04:54,637
What I have done now with that spring, probably in the beginning, I went up along this straight line, and then something like this must have happened.

54
04:55,097 --> 04:58,517
I got a huge extension. My force did not increase very much.

55
04:58,827 --> 05:04,667
And then when I relaxed, when I took my force off, this spring was longer at the end than it was at the beginning.

56
05:05,127 --> 05:08,577
So I have a net extension which will always be there.

57
05:08,877 --> 05:12,387
And that's not very nice, of course, to do that to a spring.

58
05:12,717 --> 05:15,257
So Hook's law holds only within certain limitations.

59
05:15,587 --> 05:19,247
You have to obey a certain amount of discipline.

60
05:19,887 --> 05:25,917
There are ways that you can also measure the spring constant in a dynamic way,

61
05:26,347 --> 05:28,367
which is actually very interesting.

62
05:29,377 --> 05:34,297
Um, I have here a spring.

63
05:35,007 --> 05:38,407
And this spring, this is X equals 0.

64
05:38,957 --> 05:46,297
And I attach now to the spring a mass M. This has to be on a frictionless surface.

65
05:46,767 --> 05:57,367
And you will see when I extend it over a distance X, that you get your force, your spring force, that drives it back.

66
05:57,807 --> 06:04,077
We have, of course, gravity, mg, and we have the normal force from the surface.

67
06:04,387 --> 06:11,497
So there is in the in the Y direction, there is no acceleration, so I don't have to worry about the forces in the Y direction at all.

68
06:12,457 --> 06:18,657
If I let this thing oscillate, I let I release it, it will start to oscillate about this point back and forth.

69
06:18,967 --> 06:32,737
Then, as I will show you now, you will find that the period of oscillation, the time for one whole oscillation is 2 pi times the square root of the mass M divided by the spring constant K.

70
06:33,777 --> 06:35,547
I will derive that. You will see that shortly.

71
06:35,777 --> 06:41,617
In other words, if you measured the period and you knew the mass, then you can calculate K.

72
06:42,017 --> 06:50,157
Alternatively, if you knew K, and you measure the period, you can calculate the mass, even in the absence of gravity.

73
06:50,447 --> 06:57,507
I don't use gravity here. So a spring always allows you to measure a mass even in the absence of gravity.

74
06:58,057 --> 07:05,747
The period that you see, the time that it takes for this object to oscillate once back and forth,

75
07:06,337 --> 07:13,227
is completely independent of how far I move it out, which is very non-intuitive, but you will see that that comes out of the derivation.

76
07:13,667 --> 07:16,397
There is no dependence on how far I move it out.

77
07:16,597 --> 07:24,317
So whether I oscillate it like this, or whether I oscillate it like this, as long as Hook's law holds,

78
07:24,517 --> 07:29,377
you will see that the period is independent of what we call that amplitude.

79
07:30,117 --> 07:33,317
So I'm going to derive the situation now for an ideal case.

80
07:33,617 --> 07:36,007
Ideal case means Hook's law must hold.

81
07:36,357 --> 07:44,577
There is no friction and the spring itself has negligible mass compared to this one. Let's call it a massless spring.

82
07:45,727 --> 07:54,617
So now I'm going to write down Newton's second law. MA, which is all in the X direction equals - kX.

83
07:55,447 --> 08:07,367
A is the second derivative of position, for which I will write X double dot mx double dot. One dot is the first derivative, that's the velocity, two dots is the acceleration.

84
08:07,667 --> 08:17,537
plus kx = 0. I divide by M and I get X double dot plus k over M times X = 0.

85
08:18,327 --> 08:24,437
And this is arguably the most important equation in all of physics.

86
08:25,667 --> 08:30,907
It's a differential equation. Some of you may already have solved differential equations.

87
08:31,447 --> 08:48,547
The outcome of this, you will see is very simple. X is of course changing in some way as a function of time, and when you have the correct solution for X as a function of time, and you substitute that back into that differential equation, that equation will have to be satisfied.

88
08:49,507 --> 08:53,707
What would a solution be to this differential equation?

89
08:54,357 --> 08:58,077
I'm going to make you see this oscillation first.

90
08:58,357 --> 09:04,127
I'm going to make you see X as a function of time and I'm going to do that in the following way.

91
09:04,647 --> 09:11,217
I have here a spray paint can which is suspended between two springs.

92
09:11,737 --> 09:17,667
And I can oscillate it vertically, which is your X direction, like that.

93
09:18,587 --> 09:20,937
So X changes with time.

94
09:21,337 --> 09:28,417
The time axis I will introduce by pulling on this string when the spray paint is going to spray.

95
09:28,697 --> 09:38,477
I'm going to pull on that string and if I can do that at a constant speed, then you get horizontally a time axis, and of course vertically vertically you will get the position of X.

96
09:38,807 --> 09:48,507
So I want you to just see qualitatively what kind of a weird curve X as a function of time is, which then will have to satisfy that differential equation.

97
09:49,337 --> 09:57,587
All right, it's always a messy experiment because the paint is dripping, but I will try to get this spray paint going. There we go.

98
09:59,037 --> 10:00,307
Okay.

99
10:01,127 --> 10:05,287
Now I'll pull.

100
10:06,237 --> 10:06,717
All right.

101
10:07,447 --> 10:08,507
Can you give me a hand?

102
10:10,647 --> 10:11,757
Yeah, could you please?

103
10:12,357 --> 10:15,137
I'll cut it here and then you

104
10:16,567 --> 10:19,667
Be very careful because it's it is messy.

105
10:21,737 --> 10:24,007
Oh, let's put it let's take it out this way.

106
10:24,427 --> 10:28,867
Okay, just walk back. Just walk. Yeah, great.

107
10:30,947 --> 10:36,227
Yeah, hold up the top so that they can see it. Fine.

108
10:37,527 --> 10:37,977
Okay.

109
10:39,547 --> 10:42,227
What is what does it remind you of?

110
10:43,447 --> 10:44,337
Sinusoid.

111
10:44,807 --> 10:46,527
Reminds me of a cosine sinusoid, by the way.

112
10:47,107 --> 10:49,517
Sinusoid or a cosine, same thing.

113
10:50,127 --> 10:54,117
All right. Well let's try to substitute in that equation

114
10:54,717 --> 11:01,157
a sinusoid or a cosine solution, whichever one you prefer, makes no difference.

115
11:01,737 --> 11:15,347
So, I'm going to substitute in this equation, this is my trial function that X as a function of time is a constant A, I will get back to that in a minute, times cosine omega t plus phi.

116
11:15,977 --> 11:19,957
This A, we call the amplitude.

117
11:20,547 --> 11:25,887
Notice the cosine function it's the highest value is plus one and the lowest value is minus one.

118
11:26,287 --> 11:35,507
So the amplitude indicates that is the farthest displacement from zero on this side would be plus A and on this side would be minus A.

119
11:35,877 --> 11:36,817
So that's in meters.

120
11:37,907 --> 11:44,157
This omega, we call the angular frequency.

121
11:44,657 --> 11:47,317
Don't confuse it with angular velocity.

122
11:47,897 --> 11:53,567
We call it angular frequency and the units are the same. The units are in radians per second.

123
11:54,057 --> 11:55,867
The same as angular velocity.

124
11:57,397 --> 12:07,577
If I advance this time little T, if I advance that by 2 pi divided by omega,

125
12:08,537 --> 12:19,137
If I advance this time by 2π divided by omega, then this angle here increases by 2π radians, which is 360°.

126
12:19,547 --> 12:22,617
And so that's the time that it takes for the oscillation to repeat itself.

127
12:23,477 --> 12:28,367
So this is the period of the oscillation, and that is in seconds.

128
12:29,207 --> 12:38,247
And you can determine if you want to, you can define the frequency of the oscillation, which is 1 over T, which we express always in terms of hertz.

129
12:38,817 --> 12:46,447
And then here we have what we call the phase angle, and I will return to that, that's in radiance.

130
12:46,867 --> 12:52,477
And this trial function, I'm going to substitute now into this equation.

131
12:52,977 --> 13:00,407
So the first thing I have to do, I have to find what the second derivative is of X as a function of time.

132
13:02,197 --> 13:03,727
Well, that's my function.

133
13:04,427 --> 13:09,077
I have here first the first derivative, X dot.

134
13:10,147 --> 13:14,417
That becomes minus A omega.

135
13:14,697 --> 13:19,547
I get an omega out because there's a time here, and now I have to take the derivative of the function itself.

136
13:19,927 --> 13:24,477
So I get the sign of omega t plus phi.

137
13:25,237 --> 13:29,607
Of course, I could have started off here with the sine curve. I hope you realize that. I just picked the cosine one.

138
13:30,547 --> 13:35,187
X double dot. Now, I get another omega out.

139
13:35,587 --> 13:44,537
So I get minus A omega squared, the derivative of the sine is the cosine, cosine omega t plus phi.

140
13:45,277 --> 13:54,487
And that is also minus omega squared times X, because notice I have A cosine omega t plus phi, which itself is X.

141
13:55,367 --> 14:00,787
So now I'm ready to substitute this result into that differential equation.

142
14:01,727 --> 14:06,527
This must always hold for any value of X, for any moment in time.

143
14:07,227 --> 14:11,677
And therefore the only way that this can work is if omega square is k over M.

144
14:12,237 --> 14:15,957
So omega square must be k over M.

145
14:16,767 --> 14:20,567
And therefore, we now have the solution to this problem.

146
14:21,657 --> 14:27,107
So we have omega equals the square root of k over M.

147
14:27,407 --> 14:32,537
And the period is 2 pi times the square root of M over K.

148
14:33,987 --> 14:40,177
And what is striking, really remarkable that this is independent of the amplitude.

149
14:40,527 --> 14:44,317
And it's also independent of this angle phi, this phase angle.

150
14:44,737 --> 14:46,927
What is this business of this phase angle?

151
14:47,307 --> 14:49,417
It's a peculiar thing that we have there.

152
14:49,777 --> 14:51,967
Well, you can think about the physics actually.

153
14:52,667 --> 15:05,017
When I start this oscillation, I have a choice of two things. I can start it off at a certain position, which I can choose. I can give it a certain displacement from zero and simply let it go.

154
15:05,587 --> 15:10,117
But I can also, when I let it go, give it a certain velocity. That's my choice.

155
15:10,427 --> 15:14,517
So I have two choices, where I let it go and what velocity I give it.

156
15:14,857 --> 15:28,407
And that is reflected in my solution, namely that ultimately in the solution, I get the result of A and the result of phi, which doesn't determine the period, but it results from what we call my initial conditions.

157
15:28,897 --> 15:37,327
And I want to do an example whereby you see how A and phi immediately follow from the initial conditions.

158
15:37,817 --> 15:44,257
So in this example, I release the object at x = 0 at t = 0.

159
15:44,697 --> 15:46,697
So I release it at equilibrium.

160
15:47,237 --> 15:52,167
At that moment in time, I give it a velocity which is - 3 m per second.

161
15:52,487 --> 15:54,327
My units are always in MKS units.

162
15:54,717 --> 15:59,177
The spring constant K equals 10 Newtons per meter.

163
15:59,657 --> 16:03,077
And the mass of the object is 0.1 kg.

164
16:04,067 --> 16:11,267
And now I can ask you, what now is X as a function of time, including the amplitude A, including the phase angle phi.

165
16:12,047 --> 16:19,187
Well, let's first calculate omega, that is the square root of K over M.

166
16:19,877 --> 16:24,157
That would be 10 radians per second.

167
16:24,597 --> 16:35,037
The period T, which is 2 pi divided by omega, would be roughly 6.28 seconds.

168
16:35,667 --> 16:41,537
And the frequency F would be about 0.16 hertz.

169
16:42,607 --> 16:44,437
Just to get some numbers.

170
16:45,147 --> 16:46,617
1.6 hertz, sorry.

171
16:47,427 --> 16:56,387
This is not my day, this is 0. 628 and this is 1.6 hertz.

172
16:57,497 --> 17:04,567
2π divided by omega, you can see, this is 10, 6 divided by 10 is about 0.6.

173
17:05,677 --> 17:10,747
All right, so now I know that at T equals 0, X equals 0.

174
17:11,447 --> 17:13,847
So I see my solution right there.

175
17:14,547 --> 17:18,657
Right here, I put in T equals 0, and I know that X is 0.

176
17:18,987 --> 17:24,627
So I get 0 equals A times the cosine of phi.

177
17:25,777 --> 17:27,907
Well, A is not zero.

178
17:28,507 --> 17:33,187
If I release that thing at equilibrium and I give it a velocity of 3 m per second, it's going to oscillate.

179
17:33,487 --> 17:34,327
So A is not zero.

180
17:34,787 --> 17:44,237
So the only solution is that cosine phi is zero, and so that leaves me with phi is pi over 2 or pi is 3 pi. phi is 3 pi over 2.

181
17:44,867 --> 17:46,837
That's the only two possibilities."

182
17:47,267 --> 17:52,047
Now I go to my next initial condition that the velocity is - 3.

183
17:52,497 --> 17:54,517
Now here you see the equation for the velocity.

184
17:55,017 --> 17:58,137
This is minus 3 at T equals 0.

185
17:58,617 --> 18:07,197
So minus 3 equals minus A and A is we don't know yet, minus A.

186
18:07,507 --> 18:15,547
And there we have omega squared omega, sorry, which is 10. T is zero, I get the sign of phi.

187
18:18,817 --> 18:27,607
If I pick pi over 2, then the sign of phi is one, and so you find immediately that A equals plus 0.3.

188
18:28,227 --> 18:33,347
And so the solution now, which includes now phi and A, is that X

189
18:33,767 --> 18:43,877
equals + 0.3 times the cosine of omega, which is 10t + pi over 2.

190
18:44,537 --> 18:52,647
So you see that the initial conditions, what the conditions are T equals zero, they determine my A and they determine my phase angle.

191
18:52,917 --> 19:03,487
If you had chosen this as the phase angle, 3 pi over 2, that would have been fine, you would have found a minus sign here, and that's exactly the same.

192
19:03,817 --> 19:06,567
So you would have found nothing different.

193
19:08,337 --> 19:21,887
I want to demonstrate to you that the period of oscillations, non-intuitive as that may be, is independent of the amplitude that I give the object.

194
19:22,357 --> 19:24,497
And I want to do that here with this air track.

195
19:25,317 --> 19:27,027
I have a an object here.

196
19:27,927 --> 19:36,347
This object has a mass 180 6 plus or minus 1 gram.

197
19:38,177 --> 19:45,047
call it M1.

198
19:45,837 --> 19:48,967
I'm going to oscillate it and we're going to measure the period.

199
19:49,437 --> 19:58,547
But instead of measuring one period, I'm going to measure 10 periods, because that gives me a smaller uncertainty, a smaller relative error in my measurement.

200
19:58,767 --> 20:05,277
So I'm going to do it as an amplitude which is 15 cm, let's make it 20 cm.

201
20:05,987 --> 20:08,037
So I get 10 T.

202
20:08,347 --> 20:13,577
I get a certain number and I get an error, which is my reaction error, which is about a 10th of a second.

203
20:14,627 --> 20:17,597
That's about the reaction error that we all have roughly.

204
20:17,867 --> 20:25,817
Then I will do it at 40 cm. We get a 10 T and we get again plus or minus one 0.1 seconds.

205
20:26,557 --> 20:30,217
And we'll see how much they differ.

206
20:30,617 --> 20:35,357
They should be the same if this is an ideal spring within the uncertainty of my measurements.

207
20:35,767 --> 20:37,367
You see the timing there.

208
20:38,317 --> 20:44,257
I'm going to give it a 20 cm offset, which is here, and then I will start it when it comes back here.

209
20:44,527 --> 20:50,417
So I will allow it one oscillation first. That's easier for me to see it stand still when I start it.

210
20:50,857 --> 20:51,547
There we go.

211
20:53,587 --> 21:08,197
One, two, three, four, five, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

212
21:09,237 --> 21:10,817
What do we see?

213
21:12,287 --> 21:13,367
15.16.

214
21:15,197 --> 21:18,427
15 16 seconds.

215
21:18,657 --> 21:24,157
By the way, you can derive the spring constant from this now, because you know the mass and you know the time.

216
21:24,847 --> 21:29,487
Now I'm going to give it in displacement, an amplitude, which is twice as high.

217
21:30,147 --> 21:31,757
So I make it 40 cm.

218
21:32,637 --> 21:37,687
So this is 10 40 cm, a huge displacement.

219
21:38,827 --> 21:54,527
Now, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.

220
21:55,697 --> 21:56,827
15.13.

221
21:58,647 --> 22:05,997
Fantastic agreement within the uncertainty of my measurements. They're within 300 of a second.

222
22:06,297 --> 22:14,587
Of course, if you try it many times, you won't always get that close because my reaction time is really not much better than a 10th of a second.

223
22:16,177 --> 22:26,517
Now, I will show you something else, which is quite interesting and that is how the behavior of the period is on the on the mass of the object.

224
22:27,847 --> 22:32,187
I have here another car, which weighs roughly the same.

225
22:32,677 --> 22:40,517
Uh, I'm going to add the two together and so we get M2 is about 372 plus or minus 1 gram.

226
22:40,827 --> 22:48,957
The plus or minus one comes in because our scale is no more accurate than 1 g. So we put them both on the scale and we find this to be the uncertainty.

227
22:50,207 --> 22:59,417
So now, I'm going to measure the 10 periods of this object which mass M2, so twice the mass.

228
22:59,817 --> 23:10,197
So that should be the square root of m2 divided by m1 times 10 times the period of m1.

229
23:10,877 --> 23:16,227
And so I can make a prediction because this is the square root of two and I know what this is.

230
23:16,927 --> 23:18,867
So I will take my calculator.

231
23:19,737 --> 23:28,177
And I will take the square root of 2 and I multiply that by uh let's take 15.15.

232
23:29,547 --> 23:38,197
And so that comes out to be 21.42. It's not clear that this two is meaningful.

233
23:38,467 --> 23:46,197
And now comes the $64 question, what is the uncertainty? This is a prediction.

234
23:47,557 --> 23:49,227
And this now becomes a little tricky.

235
23:49,697 --> 23:55,537
So what I'm telling you now may confuse you a bit, it's not meant to be, but I really won't hold you responsible for it."

236
23:55,967 --> 24:04,237
You may now think that the uncertainty in this measurement follows from the uncertainty in this, which is true, which is about 0.6%.

237
24:04,547 --> 24:10,137
And from the uncertainty in this. So this has about an uncertainty of 0.6%.

238
24:10,517 --> 24:16,207
I got it low because I measured 10 oscillations, you see? The uncertainty is only 1 out of 150, which is low.

239
24:17,227 --> 24:26,777
You may think that the uncertainty in there equals the square root of 372 plus or minus 1 divided by 186 plus or minus 1.

240
24:27,547 --> 24:41,557
And now you may argue, and that's completely reasonable that you would argue that way, you would say, well, this is roughly a quarter of a percent error here under the square root, and this is roughly half a percent error, one out of 200 is about half.

241
24:41,877 --> 24:50,517
So you would add up the two errors, a quarter plus half, that's about 0.7, and because of the square root, that becomes 0.35%.

242
24:50,777 --> 24:53,277
And that's wrong. And the reason why that is completely wrong,"

243
24:53,647 --> 24:58,467
that has to do with the fact that these two errors are coupled to each other.

244
24:58,817 --> 25:03,097
See, we the 186 is included in the 372.

245
25:03,717 --> 25:14,467
The best way I can show you this, suppose I measured m1 divided by m1, which would be 186 plus or minus 1 divided by 186 plus or minus 1.

246
25:14,907 --> 25:21,647
That number is one with 100 zeros. This number is one. You you have the mass of one object, you divided by the same object.

247
25:21,897 --> 25:28,807
Whereas if you would say, ah, this is a half a percent error, and this is a half a percent error, you would say the ratio has an error of 1% and that's not the case.

248
25:29,587 --> 25:33,217
So I will not bother you with that. I will not hold you responsible for that.

249
25:33,537 --> 25:40,507
But it turns out that if you do it correctly, and you take the error of this into account of about 0.6%."

250
25:40,947 --> 25:46,037
That the error in this ratio is really much less than 0.2%. You can almost forget about it.

251
25:46,517 --> 25:50,837
I will allow generously for a 1% error in the final answer.

252
25:51,237 --> 26:00,417
And so I stick to my prediction that the 10 T of double the mass is going to be like this.

253
26:02,647 --> 26:10,947
And now we're going to get the observation of 10 T times M2, which is double the mass.

254
26:11,627 --> 26:16,337
And that, of course, always has my uncertainty of my reaction time. There's nothing I can do about that.

255
26:17,417 --> 26:19,367
And we will compare these two numbers.

256
26:19,817 --> 26:22,697
So I will put the the other mass on top of it.

257
26:23,417 --> 26:24,327
comes here.

258
26:25,687 --> 26:29,467
tape them together so that they won't fall off.

259
26:30,647 --> 26:32,147
There we go.

260
26:34,397 --> 26:41,437
So, I hope I did that correctly, the square root of 2 times 15.15.

261
26:42,017 --> 26:46,477
We'll give it a amplitude, something like 30, maybe 35 cm. There we go.

262
26:48,667 --> 26:54,697
One, two, it's much slower, huh? You see that.

263
26:54,987 --> 27:09,307
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

264
27:09,907 --> 27:10,347
10.

265
27:11,637 --> 27:12,847
21.36.

266
27:14,857 --> 27:20,267
21. 36.

267
27:20,557 --> 27:25,177
You can round it off four if you want to, and you see that the agreement is spectacular.

268
27:25,547 --> 27:28,957
Within the uncertainty of my measurements comes out amazingly well.

269
27:29,187 --> 27:35,817
You could have removed this two, of course, because if you have an uncertainty of 0.2 here, it's a little silly to have this little two hanging there.

270
27:36,127 --> 27:40,147
But you see that indeed, this spring is very close to an ideal spring.

271
27:40,637 --> 27:45,357
It obeys Hook's law, and it is also nearly massless.

272
27:46,117 --> 27:47,347
Here is the pendulum.

273
27:48,307 --> 27:53,017
Here is the mass and it's offset at an angle theta.

274
27:53,917 --> 27:57,517
The length of the pendulum is L, the length of the string.

275
27:58,057 --> 28:01,197
There is gravity here, mg.

276
28:02,197 --> 28:08,597
And the other force on the object, the only other force is the tension T.

277
28:09,567 --> 28:12,517
Don't confuse that with period T. This is tension T. It's in Newtons.

278
28:13,437 --> 28:16,327
Those are the only two forces. There is nothing else.

279
28:16,907 --> 28:23,307
The thing is going to arc around like this and it's going to oscillate.

280
28:25,187 --> 28:27,277
I call this the Y direction.

281
28:28,057 --> 28:33,637
And I call this the X direction, and here X equals 0.

282
28:35,457 --> 28:44,537
Well, I'm going to decompose the tension into the Y and into the X direction as we have done before.

283
28:46,437 --> 28:48,657
So this is going to be the Y component.

284
28:49,617 --> 28:51,967
X component.

285
28:53,367 --> 28:58,487
So this Y component equals T cosine theta.

286
28:58,887 --> 29:05,237
And the X component equals T sin theta.

287
29:06,087 --> 29:11,207
And now I'm going to write down the differential equations of motion, first in the X direction.

288
29:13,457 --> 29:19,267
Second Newton's second law. MA equals."

289
29:19,777 --> 29:27,377
This is the only force in the X direction. It's a restoring force, just like with the spring. I therefore have to give it a minus sign.

290
29:27,627 --> 29:31,727
So equals minus T times the sin of theta."

291
29:32,717 --> 29:37,207
T itself could easily be a function of theta. So I have to allow for that.

292
29:37,647 --> 29:43,547
The sin of theta equals X, if it's here at position X divided by L."

293
29:44,337 --> 29:51,427
And so I can write for this minus T which may be a function of theta times X divided by L.

294
29:51,957 --> 29:55,547
That is my differential equation in the X direction.

295
29:55,897 --> 30:01,287
And I prefer always for this A to write down X double dot.

296
30:01,917 --> 30:03,207
Now the Y direction.

297
30:04,347 --> 30:08,937
In the Y direction, I have M Y double dot equals.

298
30:09,907 --> 30:18,297
This is my plus direction, so I have T cosine theta - mg.

299
30:19,117 --> 30:22,407
This is equation one, and this is equation two."

300
30:22,887 --> 30:29,527
And so now we have to solve two coupled differential equations, which is a hopeless task.

301
30:29,967 --> 30:32,387
It looks like a zoo, and it is a zoo.

302
30:33,207 --> 30:36,047
And now we're going to make some approximations.

303
30:36,457 --> 30:48,077
And the approximations that we will make, which we will often see in physics, when something oscillates, is what we call the small angle approximations.

304
30:49,117 --> 30:54,467
Small angle, we will not allow theta to become too large.

305
30:54,927 --> 30:57,607
I'll be quantitative what I mean by too large.

306
30:58,017 --> 31:04,227
When theta, which is in radians equals much much less than one, we call that a small angle.

307
31:05,117 --> 31:11,327
If that's the case, the cosine of theta is very close to one.

308
31:11,817 --> 31:14,857
You will say, well, how close to one?

309
31:15,337 --> 31:21,307
Okay, 5 degrees. The cosine is 0.996.

310
31:21,887 --> 31:22,837
That's close to one.

311
31:23,177 --> 31:31,017
10 degrees, the cosine is 0.985. That's only 1 and a half% different from one.

312
31:31,447 --> 31:34,367
So even at 10 degrees, you're doing extremely well.

313
31:35,577 --> 31:40,447
So this is consequence number one of the small angle approximation.

314
31:41,187 --> 31:44,797
But there is a second consequence of the small angle approximation.

315
31:46,227 --> 31:52,467
Look at the excursion that this object made from equilibrium in X direction. That's this big.

316
31:52,857 --> 31:57,517
Look at the excursion it makes in the Y direction. It's this small.

317
31:57,957 --> 32:04,607
It's way smaller than the excursion in the X direction, provided that your angle is small.

318
32:05,687 --> 32:06,807
I'll give you an example.

319
32:07,577 --> 32:13,557
At 5 degrees, this excursion is only 4% of this excursion.

320
32:14,107 --> 32:18,567
At 10 degrees, this excursion is only 9% of this excursion.

321
32:19,037 --> 32:31,997
And since the excursion in the Y direction is so much smaller than in the X direction, we say that the acceleration in the Y direction can be approximated to be roughly zero.

322
32:32,537 --> 32:35,677
There is almost no acceleration in the Y direction.

323
32:36,467 --> 32:44,147
With these two conclusions which follow from the small angle approximation, I go back to my equation number two.

324
32:45,127 --> 32:46,797
And I find that zero

325
32:47,577 --> 32:55,227
equals T which could be a function of theta. The cosine of theta is 1 - mg.

326
32:55,727 --> 32:59,147
So I find that T equals mg.

327
32:59,617 --> 33:02,367
Notice, it's no longer even a function of theta.

328
33:02,747 --> 33:09,417
So I simply have in my small angle approximation that I can make T the same as mg.

329
33:09,737 --> 33:12,587
It's approximately, but I still put an equal sign there.

330
33:13,057 --> 33:17,137
I substitute this back in my equation number one.

331
33:17,547 --> 33:22,197
And so now I get that M times X double dot

332
33:22,777 --> 33:25,297
And I bring this on the other side plus

333
33:26,027 --> 33:34,157
T is now mg mg times X divided by L equals 0.

334
33:34,687 --> 33:35,547
And now

335
33:36,467 --> 33:43,777
comes the wonderful result. X double dot plus g over L times X equals 0.

336
33:44,607 --> 33:48,667
And this is such a beautiful result that it almost makes me cry.

337
33:49,417 --> 33:53,447
This is a simple harmonic oscillation.

338
33:53,957 --> 34:01,137
This equation looks like a carbon copy of the one that we have there.

339
34:01,757 --> 34:06,277
Here we have K over M. And there we have G over L.

340
34:06,527 --> 34:09,577
That's all. Other than that, there is no difference.

341
34:10,077 --> 34:14,507
So you can write down immediately the solution to this differential equation.

342
34:15,417 --> 34:24,137
X will be some amplitude times the cosine of omega t plus phi just as we had before.

343
34:24,467 --> 34:35,417
And omega will now be the square root of g over L, and so the period of the pendulum will be 2 pi times the square root of L over G.

344
34:37,167 --> 34:41,127
Just falls into our lap because we did all the work.

345
34:42,187 --> 34:47,217
I want you to realize that these results for a pendulum have their restrictions.

346
34:47,547 --> 34:52,117
Small angles, and we discussed quantitatively how small you would like to allow.

347
34:52,407 --> 34:57,477
And also the mass has to be exclusively in here and not in the string.

348
34:57,747 --> 35:00,587
We call that a massless string.

349
35:01,067 --> 35:08,177
To give you some rough idea of what these periods will be, substitute for L 1 meter.

350
35:08,797 --> 35:17,567
And you take for G 9.8, you take the square root, and you multiply by 2 pi, and what you find is that the period is about 2 seconds.

351
35:18,157 --> 35:22,687
So, a pendulum 1 meter long has a period of about 2 seconds.

352
35:25,947 --> 35:31,577
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

353
35:32,087 --> 35:34,487
So to go from here to here is about 1 second.

354
35:35,187 --> 35:37,237
If I make it four times shorter,

355
35:37,867 --> 35:41,747
L four times shorter, the square root of 4 is two.

356
35:41,997 --> 35:48,537
Then the period is the period is changing, four times shorter, the period must be two times shorter.

357
35:49,007 --> 35:55,427
Make roughly 25 cm. I'm not trying to be very quantitative here. Now the whole period must be about 1 second.

358
35:56,187 --> 36:02,457
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

359
36:02,777 --> 36:03,877
roughly 1 second.

360
36:04,127 --> 36:11,657
So you see that the period is extremely sensitive to the length of the string.

361
36:14,047 --> 36:26,517
I now want to compare with you the results that we have for the spring with the results that we have from the pendulum to give you some further insight.

362
36:26,827 --> 36:31,147
We have the string and we have the pendulum.

363
36:31,937 --> 36:39,337
And I'm only going to look at the period T which here is 2 pi divided by the square root of M over K.

364
36:39,667 --> 36:43,527
And here is 2 pi times the square root of L over G.

365
36:45,727 --> 36:48,927
If I look here, there is a mass in here.

366
36:49,637 --> 36:52,407
If I look here, it's independent of the mass."

367
36:53,577 --> 36:55,337
Why is there a mass in here?

368
36:55,817 --> 36:57,617
That is very easy to see.

369
36:58,297 --> 37:07,067
If I take a spring and I extend the spring over a certain distance, then there is a certain force that I feel.

370
37:08,007 --> 37:11,247
That force is independent of the mass that I put at the end of the spring.

371
37:11,647 --> 37:17,747
The spring doesn't know what the mass is you're going to put on. All it knows is I am too long and I want to go back to equilibrium.

372
37:18,367 --> 37:29,147
That force is a fixed force. If I double the mass, that fixed force will give on double the mass half the acceleration. If the acceleration goes down, the period of oscillation goes up.

373
37:29,417 --> 37:30,257
It's very clear.

374
37:30,657 --> 37:35,607
So you can immediately see that with a spring, the mass must enter into the period.

375
37:36,337 --> 37:38,127
Now go to the pendulum."

376
37:38,467 --> 37:48,207
If I double the mass of my bob at the end of a pendulum, then the vertical component of the tension will also double.

377
37:48,747 --> 37:53,207
That means this restoring force, which is proportional with the tension, will also double.

378
37:53,697 --> 37:59,917
So now the restoring force doubles and the mass doubles, the acceleration remains the same, the period remains the same.

379
38:00,717 --> 38:05,577
So you can simply argue that there should be no mass in here, and there isn't.

380
38:06,397 --> 38:07,597
How about this K?

381
38:07,997 --> 38:11,117
If K is high, then a spring is stiff.

382
38:11,427 --> 38:12,677
What does it mean a stiff spring?

383
38:13,017 --> 38:18,277
It means that if I give it a small extension, that the spring force is huge.

384
38:18,697 --> 38:26,137
If I have a huge spring force, the acceleration on a given mass will be high. If I have a high acceleration, the period will be short.

385
38:26,617 --> 38:31,207
And that's exactly what you see. If K is high, the period will be short.

386
38:32,147 --> 38:33,407
G.

387
38:34,437 --> 38:38,867
Imagine that you have a pendulum in outer space. There is no gravity, nothing.

388
38:39,227 --> 38:45,577
The pendulum will not swing. The period of the pendulum will be infinitely long.

389
38:45,867 --> 39:01,657
Go into the shuttle where the perceived gravity in their frame of reference, perceived, they're weightless, remember, their perceived gravity is zero. You take a pendulum in the shuttle and you put it at this angle, you let it go, it will stay there forever and ever and ever. The period is infinitely long.

390
39:02,477 --> 39:07,657
But take a spring in the shuttle and let the spring oscillate, and it does.

391
39:07,987 --> 39:15,777
So you can actually measure the mass of an object using a spring on the shuttle and let it oscillate if you know the spring constant. And that's the way it's actually done.

392
39:16,807 --> 39:26,607
So, you see indeed that these things make sense when you think about it in a rational way.

393
39:28,107 --> 39:33,557
We have here in 26100, the mother of all pendulums.

394
39:34,357 --> 39:44,277
It is a pendulum. It is a pendulum which is um 5.1 m long.

395
39:45,677 --> 39:50,237
And there is a mass at the end of it which is 15 kg.

396
39:58,047 --> 40:05,457
The length is 5.18 m and the uncertainty is about 5 cm.

397
40:06,327 --> 40:08,837
We can't measure it any better.

398
40:10,127 --> 40:16,227
And the mass at the end of it, which doesn't enter into the period, is about 15 kg.

399
40:18,347 --> 40:25,307
The period which is 2 pi times the square root of L over G."

400
40:25,687 --> 40:33,017
If you substitute in your length of 5.1 m, you will find 4.57 seconds.

401
40:37,367 --> 40:43,717
Since you have a 1% error in L, you're going to have a half a percent error in your period.

402
40:43,987 --> 40:47,337
So that is about 0.02 seconds.

403
40:48,107 --> 40:49,777
So this is my prediction.

404
40:52,537 --> 40:52,967
.

405
40:55,007 --> 40:55,437
.

406
40:57,307 --> 41:04,617
And now I'm going to oscillate it for you and I'm going to do it from two different angles.

407
41:04,937 --> 41:10,647
I'm going to do it at a 5 degree angle and I'm going to do it at a 10 degree angle.

408
41:10,957 --> 41:16,907
In order to get my relative error down, I will oscillate 10 times.

409
41:17,357 --> 41:32,117
So I'm going to get at an angle theta maximum of roughly 5 degrees, I get 10 T equals something plus or minus my reaction time, which is 0.1 of a second.

410
41:32,487 --> 41:41,477
And then I will do it from 10 degrees, and I will do again 10 T, and again my reaction time is not much better than 0.1 second.

411
41:42,067 --> 41:43,527
So let's do that first."

412
41:44,847 --> 41:53,237
I will move this out of the way because if that 15 kg object hits this, that is not funny.

413
41:54,307 --> 41:55,437
All right.

414
41:56,457 --> 41:57,687
Zero.

415
41:58,837 --> 42:05,307
I have a mark here on the floor. This is about 5 degrees, and this is about 10 degrees.

416
42:05,757 --> 42:07,987
I will first do it from 5 degrees."

417
42:08,517 --> 42:13,707
I will let it swing one oscillation and when it comes to a hold here, I will start the time. That's for me the easiest.

418
42:14,317 --> 42:17,517
But I count on you when it comes to counting.

419
42:17,907 --> 42:19,387
You ready?"

420
42:19,637 --> 42:21,447
You ready? You sure?

421
42:21,637 --> 42:22,447
I'm ready too.

422
42:25,457 --> 42:27,117
Okay.

423
42:27,507 --> 42:33,777
Now keep counting and don't confuse me again. You're completely responsible for the counting.

424
42:34,517 --> 42:39,117
So you only have to tell me is when when eight or nine is coming up. That's all I want to know.

425
42:39,427 --> 42:41,357
Don't even bother me with three.

426
42:41,557 --> 42:42,737
Don't even bother me with four.

427
42:43,157 --> 42:47,627
Just let me know when I have to get in position for the final kill.

428
42:52,577 --> 42:59,287
Notice there's almost no damping on this pendulum. The amplitude remains almost the same, whereas with the with the air track, you could actually see that there was already some kind of friction.

429
42:59,587 --> 43:01,117
It was Where are we now?

430
43:04,627 --> 43:08,157
Nine? Nine, right?

431
43:10,827 --> 43:13,567
Seven.

432
43:15,097 --> 43:17,887
45.70."

433
43:19,187 --> 43:25,087
45 70. Where is my chalk?

434
43:25,527 --> 43:29,797
45 .70.

435
43:30,577 --> 43:33,037
What was my prediction?

436
43:36,267 --> 43:37,097
Yeah.

437
43:37,507 --> 43:38,217
Yeah.

438
43:38,487 --> 43:38,737
Yeah.

439
43:39,097 --> 43:40,757
Yeah, exactly.

440
43:40,967 --> 43:42,257
You get the picture.

441
43:43,137 --> 43:44,397
That is pure luck.

442
43:44,797 --> 43:48,337
Because my accuracy is no better than a 10th of a second.

443
43:48,527 --> 43:50,737
Now we do from 10 10 degrees."

444
43:51,057 --> 43:58,417
And I want to show you now that the effect on the angle, if you go from 5 to 10, is small.

445
43:58,647 --> 44:01,227
So small that you cannot measure it within the accuracy of your measurement.

446
44:05,597 --> 44:06,877
Yeah.

447
44:07,327 --> 44:09,577
Okay.

448
44:10,007 --> 44:12,627
Again, relax and count.

449
44:36,547 --> 44:37,707
Seven.

450
44:41,077 --> 44:43,487
Eight.

451
44:45,847 --> 44:49,717
Nine.

452
44:51,337 --> 44:54,117
10.

453
44:54,717 --> 44:56,557
Did you expect anything else?

454
44:57,247 --> 44:59,197
45.75.

455
45:00,497 --> 45:06,207
45 .75.

456
45:06,537 --> 45:16,207
One of the most remarkable things I just mentioned to you is that the period of the oscillations is independent of the mass of the object.

457
45:16,847 --> 45:25,227
That would mean if I join the Bob and I swing down with the Bob, that you should get that same period.

458
45:25,567 --> 45:27,157
Or should you not?"

459
45:27,817 --> 45:32,727
I'm asking you a question before we do this awful experiment.

460
45:34,137 --> 45:38,057
Would the period come out to be the same or not?

461
45:38,807 --> 45:40,757
Some of you think it's the same.

462
45:41,647 --> 45:58,377
Have you thought about it that I'm a little bit taller than this object, and that therefore maybe effectively the the length of the string has become a little less if I sit up like this? And if the length of the spring is a little less, the period would be a little shorter.

463
45:59,337 --> 46:00,957
Yeah?

464
46:01,217 --> 46:02,417
Be prepared for that.

465
46:02,707 --> 46:06,357
On the other hand, I'm also well, I'm not quite prepared for it."

466
46:07,527 --> 46:15,737
I will try to hold my body as horizontal as I possibly can in order to be at the same level as the Bob.

467
46:16,087 --> 46:18,747
I will start when I come to a hold here.

468
46:18,987 --> 46:19,877
There we go."

469
46:24,197 --> 46:27,477
Now. You count."

470
46:29,357 --> 46:31,407
This hurts.

471
46:33,067 --> 46:34,417
Oh.

472
46:37,547 --> 46:39,817
I want to hear you loud.

473
46:43,567 --> 46:48,817
Oh.

474
46:49,567 --> 46:51,717
Ah, thank you.

475
46:52,197 --> 46:57,317
Oh.

476
47:06,567 --> 47:07,857
What?

477
47:09,117 --> 47:10,437
10.

478
47:10,707 --> 47:11,607
Oh!

479
47:15,367 --> 47:25,007
10 T with Walter Lewin 45.6 plus or minus 0.1 second.

480
47:25,277 --> 47:27,797
Physics works, I'm telling you.

481
47:33,597 --> 47:38,167
I'll see you Monday. Have a good weekend.

482
47:39,567 --> 47:41,047
