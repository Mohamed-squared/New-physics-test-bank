1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:06,078
The exam on Wednesday
will cover our first

2
00:06,078 --> 00:12,668
five lectures and the first two homework assignments.

3
00:13,128 --> 00:17,888
And so I list here the topics, the way we discussed them.

4
00:18,818 --> 00:27,648
Of course, it is not possible to discuss all of them today, but I will make a selection.

5
00:28,888 --> 00:33,208
I recall that we discussed scaling

6
00:33,918 --> 00:38,428
and we used the interesting example of Galileo Galilei.

7
00:39,448 --> 00:42,838
animal and the animal has legs.

8
00:43,878 --> 00:51,838
And we defined the overall size of the animal as say big. We call that S.

9
00:52,818 --> 00:57,588
And then we said, well, there is here the femur.

10
00:58,938 --> 01:03,278
And the femur has length L and thickness D.

11
01:04,278 --> 01:15,228
It was completely reasonable to say, well, that L will have to be proportional to S. If an animal is 10 times larger than another, legs will be typically 10 times longer.

12
01:16,768 --> 01:28,298
Since the mass of the animal must be proportional to its size to the power three, will also be proportional to the length of the femur to the power three.

13
01:28,298 --> 01:36,948
And then came in this key argument, namely, you don't want the bones to be crushed, which is called yielding in physics.

14
01:37,718 --> 01:44,338
If I take a piece of concrete, a block of concrete, and I put too much pressure on it, it starts to crumble.

15
01:44,638 --> 01:47,858
And that's what Galileo Galilei may have had in mind.

16
01:48,748 --> 01:59,218
And in order to protect animals who get bigger and bigger and bigger against this crushing, we argued, and I will not go through that argument now anymore,

17
01:59,518 --> 02:05,888
that the mass will have to be proportional to D squared, which is the cross section of the femur.

18
02:06,818 --> 02:17,718
And so, you see immediately that D square has to be proportional to L to the third, so D must be proportional to the length of the femur to the power 1 and 1/2.

19
02:18,348 --> 02:30,948
So this would mean that if you compare an elephant with a mouth, the elephant overall size is about 100 times larger than a mouth, you would expect the femur to be about 100 times larger, which is true.

20
02:31,678 --> 02:38,218
But you would then expect the femur to be about 1 thousand times thicker, and that turns out to be not true, as we have seen.

21
02:38,628 --> 02:45,688
In fact, the femur of the elephant is only 100 times thicker. So it scales just as the size.

22
02:46,478 --> 02:48,628
So that was a scaling argument.

23
02:49,748 --> 02:57,978
And let's now talk about dot products. If I look there, I scan a little bit in a random way over my topics.

24
02:58,418 --> 03:01,968
So let's now talk about dot products.

25
03:03,798 --> 03:18,528
I have a vector A Ax * X roof, which is the unit vector in the X direction, plus Ay Y roof plus AZ Z roof.

26
03:19,118 --> 03:26,728
So these are the three unit vectors in the XY and Z direction, and these are the X component, Y and the Z component of the vector A.

27
03:27,498 --> 03:40,678
I have another vector B, B of X X roof, B of Y Y roof, B of Z Z roof.

28
03:41,928 --> 03:58,028
Now the dot product A dot B, also called the scalar product, is the same as B. A and it is defined as AX BX

29
03:58,688 --> 04:08,638
plus A B Y plus A Z B of Z.

30
04:08,638 --> 04:09,628
It is a number.

31
04:10,268 --> 04:12,488
It is a scalar, it is simple number.

32
04:13,038 --> 04:21,538
And so this number can be larger than zero, can be positive, it can be equal to zero, but it can also be smaller than zero.

33
04:22,178 --> 04:24,438
We just dump numbers.

34
04:25,308 --> 04:33,808
There is another way that you can define, you can call this method number one, if you if you prefer that.

35
04:34,068 --> 04:40,018
There is another way that you can find the dot product, which gives you exactly the same result.

36
04:40,698 --> 04:44,498
If you have a vector A

37
04:45,148 --> 04:51,598
and you have the vector B and the angle between them is theta,

38
04:52,308 --> 04:56,928
then you can project B on A or A on B for that matter, it makes no difference.

39
04:57,678 --> 05:06,388
And that projection, the length of this projection is then of course B cosine theta.

40
05:07,738 --> 05:11,988
And so A. B

41
05:12,488 --> 05:26,418
and that is exactly the same, you may want to go through a proof of that, it is the length of A times the length of B times cosine of theta.

42
05:27,528 --> 05:29,828
And that will give you precisely the same result.

43
05:31,058 --> 05:45,088
What is interesting about this formulation, which this lacks, that you can immediately see that if the two are at 90 degree angles or 270 degrees for that matter, then the dot product is zero.

44
05:45,878 --> 05:51,748
So that's a an insight that you get through this one, which you lack through that other method.

45
05:53,228 --> 05:59,538
Let us take a down-to-earth example of a dot product.

46
06:00,538 --> 06:12,628
Suppose A equals 3x and B equals 2x + 2y.

47
06:13,808 --> 06:15,678
And I'm asking you what is the dot product.

48
06:16,838 --> 06:24,608
Well, you could use method number one, which in this case is by far the fastest, believe me.

49
06:25,238 --> 06:29,088
AX is 3 and BX is 2, so that gives me a 6.

50
06:33,468 --> 06:38,228
There is no A Y, there is no A Z, so this is the answer. It's just six.

51
06:39,488 --> 06:40,638
That's the dot product.

52
06:41,448 --> 06:49,078
You could have done it that way, it's a little bit more complicated, but I certainly want to show you that it works.

53
06:50,768 --> 06:58,928
If this is the X direction, and this is the Y direction, we don't have to look into the Z direction because there is no Z component.

54
06:59,678 --> 07:08,558
Then this would be vector A and this point would be at three.

55
07:10,938 --> 07:20,018
B, this would be two, and this would be two. And so this would be the vector B.

56
07:24,568 --> 07:28,348
And it's immediately clear now that this angle 45 degrees.

57
07:28,688 --> 07:31,748
That follows from the two and the two.

58
07:32,128 --> 07:38,448
So if we now apply method number two, A. B.

59
07:39,258 --> 07:42,128
First the length of A, that's three.

60
07:43,488 --> 07:49,228
Times the length of B, that is two times the square root of 2.

61
07:50,268 --> 07:59,038
This is two, this is two, this is two square root 2 times the cosine of 45 degrees, which is 1/2 square root 2.

62
07:59,038 --> 07:59,848
And the answer is six.

63
08:00,308 --> 08:05,268
Notice that this square root of 2 and this square root of 2 eat up this two and you get six.

64
08:05,598 --> 08:06,698
You get the same answer, of course.

65
08:07,208 --> 08:12,488
But it would be a dumb thing to do it since it can be done so much easier.

66
08:14,068 --> 08:22,038
Uh on cross products, I don't want to go through the formalism of cross products the way we did that with the determinant.

67
08:22,518 --> 08:33,778
I just want to remind you that if you have a cross product of two vectors, that is minus B cross A.

68
08:35,848 --> 08:50,058
And that the the magnitude of C is the length of A times the length of B times the sign of the angle

69
08:50,818 --> 08:51,748
between them.

70
08:55,288 --> 09:04,408
The vector C, the dot product, the cross product is always perpendicular to both A and perpendicular to B.

71
09:04,988 --> 09:08,998
In other words, it's perpendicular to the plane of the two vectors.

72
09:10,768 --> 09:15,028
Now, if it's perpendicular to the plane, then in that case, it's perpendicular to the blackboard.

73
09:15,028 --> 09:20,548
You have two choices. It's either coming at you perpendicular or it's coming straight into the blackboard.

74
09:20,938 --> 09:30,088
And now everyone has so his own way of doing it. I taught you what's called the right hand cork screw rule.

75
09:30,468 --> 09:37,798
You take the first one that is mentioned, in this case A, and you rotate it over the shortest angle to B.

76
09:38,628 --> 09:55,368
When you do that, you rotate your cork screw seen from where you're sitting counterclockwise, then the cork screw comes to you, and so the direction of the vector is such that you will see the tip of the vector, so it's coming straight out of the blackboard.

77
09:55,368 --> 09:56,378
And so that gives you then

78
09:56,678 --> 09:57,258
the direction.

79
10:03,048 --> 10:20,428
Now I will give you the position X of an object as a function of time, and then we're going to ask ourselves a lot of questions about velocities, accelerations,

80
10:20,968 --> 10:25,418
sort of everything you can think of, everything we have covered, speeds.

81
10:25,778 --> 10:27,788
And I will cover here four seconds of time.

82
10:28,008 --> 10:33,398
So this is the time axis in seconds.

83
10:34,378 --> 10:36,148
And we will cover 4 seconds.

84
10:37,178 --> 10:44,118
So let this be one, two, three, four.

85
10:46,098 --> 10:52,848
And let the object be at position plus six.

86
10:53,838 --> 10:59,298
This is my X-axis. This is where the object is actually moving.

87
11:00,588 --> 11:02,638
And this is three.

88
11:03,868 --> 11:08,998
And here is minus three. And this let's say is in meters.

89
11:11,218 --> 11:22,708
Let's make a little grid so that it's easier for me to put in the the curve.

90
11:24,758 --> 11:28,458
Okay.

91
11:32,238 --> 11:32,918
All right.

92
11:33,748 --> 11:37,528
So now comes X as a function of T.

93
11:39,938 --> 11:49,048
At time T equals T seconds,

94
11:50,948 --> 12:00,998
And this part is a parabola, and this parabola here is horizontal.

95
12:01,978 --> 12:11,698
It's important that you have to know that. So this is a parabola, and this here is horizontal.

96
12:13,498 --> 12:19,538
So the object goes from +6 to 3, then it goes to -3.

97
12:20,138 --> 12:29,238
Then it stays there for one second, and then it goes back in one second to +6.

98
12:30,448 --> 12:37,748
It's a one-dimensional problem, the motion is only in the X axis along the X direction.

99
12:38,778 --> 12:42,798
Let's analyze all these different seconds that occur.

100
12:43,758 --> 12:50,848
Let's first take the first second during the first second.

101
12:51,748 --> 12:56,128
Since this is a parabola, you know that the acceleration is constant.

102
12:56,918 --> 13:02,018
So, I hope you will conclude immediately that A must be a constant.

103
13:02,018 --> 13:17,338
If A is a constant, the position X as a function of time should change as follows, X0 + V0t + 12 A T square.

104
13:19,698 --> 13:22,248
I expect you to know this equation.

105
13:23,698 --> 13:32,968
Very often do I give you equations at the exam, and that may well happen during the second and the third exam, but it will not be the case this time.

106
13:33,368 --> 13:39,078
The equations are all very fundamental, and you have to make them part of your world.

107
13:39,398 --> 13:43,778
So this is an equation that you will have to remember.

108
13:44,908 --> 13:49,858
All right. What is the velocity here?

109
13:51,018 --> 13:53,878
The velocity starts out to be zero.

110
13:54,828 --> 13:58,358
And the velocity here is not zero anymore.

111
14:00,528 --> 14:04,018
If I look at time T equals 1,

112
14:05,628 --> 14:08,718
then I have here X0 was 6.

113
14:09,668 --> 14:11,908
It starts out with velocity zero, that's a given.

114
14:12,908 --> 14:18,788
And I get + 12 times square, but this is only 1 second.

115
14:21,688 --> 14:37,578
And so when it is at three, I have 6 + 12 A * 1 squared, and so you'll find that A equals - 6 m per second square.

116
14:37,578 --> 14:43,958
So during this first second, the acceleration is - 6 m per second squared.

117
14:44,948 --> 15:00,408
And the velocity V as a function of time is the derivative of this one is V0 + AT. V0 was zero, and so that is minus 6 * T.

118
15:00,408 --> 15:04,488
So the velocity is changing in a linear fashion.

119
15:05,838 --> 15:11,278
What do I know about the end of the first second?

120
15:11,988 --> 15:14,128
Well, I can say that X is 3.

121
15:17,438 --> 15:22,518
What do I know about the velocity? Well, the velocity is minus 6.

122
15:27,218 --> 15:28,738
What do I know about A?

123
15:30,468 --> 15:31,438
I don't.

124
15:32,168 --> 15:33,898
I don't know about A.

125
15:34,848 --> 15:49,408
It's true that during this first second, A is - 6 m per second square, but it changes abruptly at this point, so it's ill defined at that point. In fact, it's actually non-physical. So I really don't know exactly at the end what the acceleration is.

126
15:53,768 --> 15:55,988
Let's now go to the second second.

127
15:56,668 --> 16:00,108
And let's see what happens there.

128
16:03,528 --> 16:06,018
Second, second.

129
16:07,638 --> 16:12,708
And first, let's look during.

130
16:13,478 --> 16:15,768
And then we'll look at situation at the end.

131
16:16,848 --> 16:30,818
During the second second, it is clear since this is a straight line that the velocity remains constant and it remains minus 6 m per second. That is exactly what it was at this point at the end.

132
16:30,948 --> 16:42,518
You can see it goes 6 m from + 3 to - 3 in 1 second. So the velocity is minus 6 m per second.

133
16:44,038 --> 16:47,158
The acceleration is therefore zero.

134
16:47,738 --> 16:56,878
You see that the acceleration changes abruptly from - 6 m per second square to zero. So I can't tell you what it is exactly at this moment in time.

135
16:58,538 --> 17:04,198
So that's the situation during the second second.

136
17:04,458 --> 17:10,248
And what is the situation at the end of the second section, second, second?

137
17:11,928 --> 17:15,338
At the end, I know that x equals - 3.

138
17:16,778 --> 17:19,708
What is the velocity? I don't know.

139
17:20,638 --> 17:27,408
Because it changes abruptly here from minus 6 to zero. So I don't know exactly what it is at that point. It's a non physical thing. It's a very abrupt change.

140
17:29,688 --> 17:36,088
And the acceleration, yeah, that's also a very tricky thing.

141
17:36,418 --> 17:50,878
Because if the velocity is minus 6 on this side of the two seconds and here becomes zero, and if that happens at in a split second, there must be a huge acceleration just at that point, which is non-physical.

142
17:51,968 --> 17:54,608
So I would also put a question mark at the A.

143
17:54,608 --> 17:55,838
I don't know what the A is.

144
17:57,738 --> 17:59,208
So we go to the third second.

145
18:00,588 --> 18:01,938
This part.

146
18:04,248 --> 18:08,108
Let's first look during the third second.

147
18:08,828 --> 18:18,278
Well, the object isn't going anywhere, just sitting there. X remains minus 3.

148
18:19,588 --> 18:25,508
And the velocity is zero and A is zero. We can agree on that.

149
18:26,838 --> 18:33,068
What is the situation at the end of the third second? That means T equals 3.

150
18:33,828 --> 18:36,038
Well, all I know is that x is minus 3.

151
18:36,348 --> 18:37,438
That's non-negotiable.

152
18:38,678 --> 18:45,788
What the velocity is, I don't know, because it's changing abruptly from zero to a positive value.

153
18:46,248 --> 18:50,108
So that's ill defined. And the same is true for the acceleration.

154
18:50,108 --> 18:54,848
There is a sudden change in velocity, that means there must be a huge acceleration.

155
18:55,408 --> 19:01,858
It's unknown, ill-defined, because this curve is of course not very physical.

156
19:02,988 --> 19:07,108
Let's now look at the last second. It's the fourth second.

157
19:09,498 --> 19:10,818
First during.

158
19:12,828 --> 19:24,068
Well, it's going from minus three to plus six and it's a straight line, so the velocity is constant. If the velocity is constant, then you can immediately conclude that A is zero, there's no acceleration.

159
19:24,528 --> 19:33,478
And it goes 9 m in a time span of 1 second. But it's now plus plus 9 m per second.

160
19:34,188 --> 19:54,768
So the object first went from positive values of X to zero and to negative values for X. During all that time, the velocity was negative by our sign convention. And now the velocity, it goes back to +6. The velocity becomes plus 9 m per second.

161
19:56,158 --> 19:58,458
What is the story at the end of the four second?

162
19:59,258 --> 20:02,508
Well, all I can say is that x equals + 6.

163
20:03,058 --> 20:09,528
I don't know much more. I don't know what the velocity is, neither do I know what the acceleration is. The plot stops there anyhow.

164
20:13,898 --> 20:23,268
Now, I would think that it is reasonable to ask the following question, what is the average velocity, for instance, between time zero and time four?

165
20:23,808 --> 20:25,388
Average velocity.

166
20:25,908 --> 20:35,098
We define average velocity as the position at time 4 seconds minus the position at time zero divided by four.

167
20:35,098 --> 20:36,778
That is our definition.

168
20:37,298 --> 20:41,418
At zero it is at plus six, at four it is at plus six.

169
20:41,748 --> 20:43,208
So the upstairs is zero.

170
20:43,668 --> 20:48,898
So the average velocity during this four second trip is zero.

171
20:49,678 --> 20:51,108
You may not like that.

172
20:51,488 --> 20:57,698
It may go against your intuition. Of course, I couldn't agree more with you, but that's the way we define velocity.

173
20:57,938 --> 21:03,588
Speed is defined differently. Speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector.

174
21:03,978 --> 21:15,328
And the speed therefore always has a positive value. And I will show you now what is the average speed between time 0 and four.

175
21:16,208 --> 21:19,578
That is the distance that it has traveled in these four seconds.

176
21:20,668 --> 21:27,578
Well let's first go through the first second. It goes from plus c 6 to plus 3. So it already travels 3 m.

177
21:28,688 --> 21:34,838
Then in the second second, it goes from plus 3 to minus 3. So it travels another 6 m.

178
21:35,658 --> 21:48,338
And then in the third second, it's lazy, it doesn't do anything. So the distance traveled is zero. And then in the last one second, it gets very active and it travels 9 m.

179
21:49,278 --> 21:53,858
Notice you only see plus signs here. There are no minus signs that would make no sense.

180
21:54,618 --> 21:57,678
And this occurs in 4 seconds.

181
21:58,518 --> 22:05,028
So that is about 4 and 1/2 meters per second.

182
22:05,028 --> 22:11,468
So the average speed is 4 and 1/2 meters per second, but the average velocity is zero.

183
22:13,718 --> 22:31,018
We could now make a plot of the velocity as a function of time. Let me put here the 4 and 1/2 so that I just have enough room here

184
22:31,378 --> 22:33,818
to make the velocity plot.

185
22:34,578 --> 22:35,668
I'll make a new one.

186
22:37,348 --> 22:39,538
This is my time axis.

187
22:41,888 --> 22:46,078
And this is the velocity.

188
22:47,708 --> 22:48,588
This is zero.

189
22:49,758 --> 22:55,358
One second, two second, three second, four seconds.

190
22:56,728 --> 23:00,588
And this velocity is in meters per second.

191
23:04,678 --> 23:17,888
I go up here to + 10 and here is - 5, here is - 6.

192
23:19,688 --> 23:21,328
So, what do I do now?

193
23:21,328 --> 23:25,818
I know that the velocity during the first second is minus 6t.

194
23:26,348 --> 23:27,788
So it's linear.

195
23:29,298 --> 23:38,268
And so the during the first second, this is the velocity

196
23:38,518 --> 23:46,198
as a function of time. It starts at zero, you can see that. And when it is here, it has a velocity of minus 6 m per second.

197
23:47,788 --> 23:53,308
During the second second, it remains minus 6 m per second.

198
23:54,188 --> 24:02,898
So during the second second, the velocity is not changing, stays there.

199
24:03,978 --> 24:11,808
During the third second, the velocity jumps all of a sudden to zero. You see how non-physical that is.

200
24:12,588 --> 24:20,408
And so all of a sudden during the third second, it becomes zero. So there has to be somehow a connection of course between the two to make this physical.

201
24:20,838 --> 24:26,808
So in a very small amount of time, that will have to occur. That's why you get a huge acceleration here at that point.

202
24:28,448 --> 24:33,188
Of course you also get an acceleration here at this point because there's also a change in the velocity.

203
24:33,428 --> 24:42,308
And then during the fourth second, the velocity is plus 9 m per second and so we jump up.

204
24:42,928 --> 24:49,468
Let's make this plus nine.

205
24:50,958 --> 24:56,648
And so we have here during the last second.

206
24:56,648 --> 25:00,888
And again, this is non-physical, so there has to be somehow a transition.

207
25:01,738 --> 25:05,488
And so here you see the velocity as a function of time.

208
25:05,958 --> 25:07,458
Now comes an interesting question.

209
25:08,558 --> 25:17,678
Is it possible if I gave you this, so this is a given, you can't see that. Could you convert this back to that?

210
25:19,158 --> 25:36,358
And the answer is yes, provided that I tell you what the position is at T0 at T equals 0, X equals + 6, and that is sufficient for you to use this information and to reconstruct that.

211
25:37,388 --> 25:42,298
It's an interesting thing to do, and if you feel like it, I would say give it a shot.

212
25:44,918 --> 25:51,768
All right, so far about speeds and average velocities and accelerations.

213
25:52,558 --> 25:56,308
Let's now go to trajectories.

214
25:57,318 --> 26:00,188
Three-dimensional trajectories.

215
26:00,188 --> 26:07,888
Trajectories, thank goodness, are almost never three-dimensional, they're always two-dimensional.

216
26:07,888 --> 26:11,048
Because the trajectory itself is in a vertical plane.

217
26:11,408 --> 26:20,908
And so we normally, when we throw up an object in a gravitational field, you have the trajectory in a plane.

218
26:25,358 --> 26:29,938
So we'll going to have one trajectory.

219
26:31,028 --> 26:34,068
Let this be the X direction.

220
26:35,428 --> 26:39,238
And let this be the Y direction.

221
26:39,238 --> 26:44,518
increasing values of Y, increasing values of X.

222
26:46,178 --> 26:53,938
I take an object and I throw it up with an initial velocity V0.

223
26:54,268 --> 26:56,338
And what is the object going to do?

224
26:56,768 --> 27:04,208
You're going to get a parabola under the influence of gravity and it comes down here again.

225
27:06,168 --> 27:13,808
And when we have this kind of a problem, we will decompose it in two one-dimensional motions.

226
27:13,808 --> 27:18,128
One in the X direction and one in the Y direction.

227
27:19,808 --> 27:38,938
We already decompose right away the velocity at time T equals zero into a component which I call V0 X and that of course is V0 times the cosine of alpha, if the angle is alpha.

228
27:39,698 --> 27:52,738
And the velocity in the Y direction at time T equals zero, I will call that V0 in the Y direction, and that is V0 times the sign of alpha.

229
27:54,578 --> 28:04,578
And now I have to know how the object moves in the X direction as a function of time and how it behaves as a function of time in the Y direction.

230
28:04,988 --> 28:09,698
So here come the equations for the X direction.

231
28:09,988 --> 28:17,188
X as a function of time equals X0 + V0x * t.

232
28:17,188 --> 28:19,078
That's all, there is no acceleration.

233
28:22,048 --> 28:30,408
The velocity in the X direction as a function of time is simply V0 X. It never changes.

234
28:30,748 --> 28:32,958
So that's the X direction.

235
28:35,078 --> 28:36,758
Now we take the Y direction.

236
28:39,478 --> 28:50,818
Y as a function of time equals Y0 + V0 Yt + 1/2 a T2.

237
28:51,998 --> 29:02,178
My G value that I'm going to use is always positive, either 9.8 meters per second square or sometimes I make it easy to use it 10.

238
29:02,638 --> 29:03,918
Mine is always positive.

239
29:04,518 --> 29:15,798
And since in this case, I have chosen this to be the increasing value of Y, that's the only reason why I would now have to put in minus one half GT square.

240
29:15,798 --> 29:26,958
Not as some of you think because the acceleration is down. That's not a reason because I could have called this direction increasing Y, then it would have been plus one half GT squared.

241
29:27,228 --> 29:43,218
So the consequence of my choosing this, the direction in which Y increases, therefore, the plus 1/2 AT squared that you would normally see, I'm going to replace that now by minus 1/2 GT squared.

242
29:44,968 --> 29:54,468
Then the velocity in the Y direction as a function of time would be this derivative, that is V0 Y minus GT.

243
29:55,008 --> 29:57,808
And the acceleration equals minus G.

244
29:58,248 --> 30:03,538
So these are the three equations that govern the motion in the Y direction.

245
30:07,718 --> 30:13,018
This only holds if there is no air drag, no friction of any kind.

246
30:13,338 --> 30:31,848
That is very unrealistic if we are near earth, but when we are farther away from earth, as we were with the KC 135, which was flying at an altitude of about 30,000 feet, that of course is a little bit more realistic.

247
30:32,268 --> 30:56,878
And therefore the example that I have picked to throw up an object is the one whereby the KC 135 at an altitude somewhere around 25 or 30,000 feet comes in at a speed of 425 mph, turns the engines off, and then for the remaining, whatever it was, about 30 seconds, everyone, including the airplane, has no weight.

248
30:56,988 --> 31:01,518
So that's the case that I now want to work out quantitatively with you.

249
31:01,998 --> 31:13,798
In the case of the KC 35, we'll take an angle for alpha of 45 degrees, and we'll take V0, which was about 425 mph.

250
31:13,798 --> 31:16,308
You may remember that from that lecture.

251
31:16,728 --> 31:25,768
425 mph translate into about 189 meters per second.

252
31:27,118 --> 31:47,808
And so that means that the velocity V0 Y and V0 X are both the same because of the 45 degree angle. And that is of course the 189 divided by the square root of 2, and that is about 133 meters per second.

253
31:47,808 --> 31:49,558
Both are positive.

254
31:49,938 --> 31:54,568
Keep that in mind, because this is what I call the increasing value for Y. And this is the increasing value for X.

255
31:54,568 --> 31:57,808
Both positive values. Signs do matter.

256
31:58,938 --> 32:02,968
So this is given now. And now comes the first question that I could ask you on an exam.

257
32:03,698 --> 32:15,998
When is the plane at its highest point of his trajectory, and how high is it above the point where it started when it turned the engines off, when it went into free fall?

258
32:16,768 --> 32:20,948
So when is it here and what is this distance?

259
32:21,698 --> 32:28,088
Well, when is it there? That's when the velocity in the Y direction becomes zero.

260
32:28,308 --> 32:34,018
It is positive, gets smaller and smaller because of the gravitational acceleration, comes to a halt and becomes zero.

261
32:34,448 --> 32:49,418
So I ask this equation, when are you zero? This is the one I pick. And so I say zero equals + 133 - 10 * t.

262
32:51,048 --> 33:08,478
You may think that the gravitational acceleration at an altitude of 30,000 feet could be substantially less than the canonical number of 10. It is a little less, because you're a little bit further away from the earth, but it's only 0.3% less. And so we'll just accept the 10, too easy to work with.

263
33:08,858 --> 33:15,648
And so when is it at the highest point? That is when T equals 13.3 seconds.

264
33:17,408 --> 33:26,888
So that's about how long it takes to get there. When I gave the lecture last time, I said it's about 15 seconds because I made the numbers I rounded them off.

265
33:26,888 --> 33:28,488
It's about 30.3 seconds.

266
33:28,728 --> 33:36,108
And what is this distance h now? Ah, now I have to go to this equation.

267
33:36,838 --> 33:46,428
I say h equals 0 because I'm going to define the point where the plane starts its trajectory, I call that Y00, I'm free to do that.

268
33:47,188 --> 34:06,638
H = 0 + 133, that is the speed times 13.3 seconds minus 12 * G, that is 5 * 13.3 squared.

269
34:07,618 --> 34:10,648
That is what H must be.

270
34:11,138 --> 34:15,688
And that turns out to be about 885 m.

271
34:16,808 --> 34:20,228
I think I told you last time it's about 900, it's close enough.

272
34:21,798 --> 34:27,698
So we know now how long it takes to reach P and we know what the vertical distance is.

273
34:27,948 --> 34:45,448
And the whole trip back to this starting point, if we call this sort of the starting point, the starting altitude, this whole trip will take twice the amount of time to get back to this point when the engines are restarted is about 26 and a half, 27 seconds.

274
34:46,528 --> 34:50,738
How far has the plane traveled then in horizontal direction?

275
34:51,578 --> 34:55,218
Well, now I go back to this equation.

276
34:56,248 --> 35:35,108
So now I say, aha, X then, when it is back at this point, must be X0, which I conveniently choose zero, plus 133 m per second, which is the velocity in the X direction, which never changes. When the plane is here, that velocity in the X direction is the same 133 m per second as it was here, which by the way is about 300 mph. That never changes if there is no air drag or air friction of any kind. So we get plus 133 times the time. The whole trip takes 26.6 seconds.

277
35:35,108 --> 35:39,688
And that if you convert that to kilometers is about 3 and 1/2 km.

278
35:42,978 --> 35:53,608
Now you could ask yourself the question, what is the velocity of that plane when it is at that point S?

279
35:54,878 --> 36:23,078
And now you may want to abandon now this one-dimensional idea of X and Y. You may say, well, look, this is a parabola and it is completely symmetric. If the plane comes up here with 425 mph at an angle of 45 degrees, then obviously, it comes down here at an angle of 45 degrees and the speed must again be 425 mph. And you would score 100%, of course, it's clear.

280
36:24,038 --> 36:42,538
I want you to appreciate, however, that I could continue to think of this as two one-dimensional motions, and I can therefore calculate what the velocity in the X direction is at S and what the velocity in the Y direction is at S.

281
36:46,838 --> 36:51,808
So what is the velocity in the X direction at point S?

282
36:52,708 --> 36:57,048
I go to equation the second equation there. That is V0 X.

283
36:57,048 --> 37:02,488
That is plus 133 meters per second.

284
37:03,158 --> 37:10,788
What is the velocity in the Y direction? Ah, I have to go to this equation now. V0y - GT.

285
37:11,988 --> 37:20,968
So I get plus 133 - 10 times the 26.6 seconds to reach that point S.

286
37:23,178 --> 37:28,998
And what do I find? minus 133 meters per second.

287
37:29,688 --> 37:40,128
The velocity in the Y direction started off plus 133, but now it is minus 133. You see, this is sign sensitive. This is wonderful. That's the great thing about treating it that way.

288
37:42,878 --> 37:59,058
So you now know that it comes in with a velocity of 133 in the X direction, positive, 133 in the minus Y direction.

289
37:59,058 --> 38:09,488
And so what is the the net the sum of the two vectors, that of course is this vector.

290
38:09,798 --> 38:12,218
And no surprise, this angle is 45 degrees.

291
38:12,888 --> 38:19,988
And this one is the square root of 2 * 133, and that of course gives you back your 189 ms per second.

292
38:20,698 --> 38:29,438
189 ms per second. And that is 425 mph.

293
38:30,858 --> 38:41,858
I'm not recommending that you would do this, of course. It is perfectly reasonable to immediately come to that conclusion because of the symmetry of the parabola.

294
38:44,878 --> 38:49,718
Let's now turn to uniform circular motion.

295
38:51,578 --> 39:08,098
In uniform circular motion occurs when an object goes around in a circle and when the speed never changes.

296
39:08,518 --> 39:17,478
If the speed doesn't change, then the velocity, of course, does change because the direction changes all the time.

297
39:17,818 --> 39:18,468
But

298
39:19,038 --> 39:19,848
the speed does not.

299
39:20,378 --> 39:27,538
So here we have our circle. That this be radius R.

300
39:28,298 --> 39:35,398
And at this moment in time, the object is here, has a certain velocity.

301
39:36,448 --> 39:37,678
This is 90 degrees.

302
39:38,168 --> 39:47,318
And at later in time, the object is here. The speed is the same, but the direction has changed. 90 degrees.

303
39:47,998 --> 39:51,588
So these vectors should have the same length.

304
39:52,928 --> 40:08,588
In a situation like this that we have uniform circular motion. So it's uniform circular motion.

305
40:09,078 --> 40:18,768
We first identify what we call the period T in seconds, that's the time to go around.

306
40:19,898 --> 40:27,138
Then we identify what we call the frequency, that is how many times it goes around per second.

307
40:28,218 --> 40:33,728
I prefer the letter F, but our book uses the Greek letter nu.

308
40:34,148 --> 40:38,938
I find the nu often very confusing with the V of velocity, and that's why I prefer the F.

309
40:39,918 --> 40:40,958
It is 1 over T.

310
40:41,998 --> 40:48,118
And so the units are second minus one, but most physicist would call that Hertz.

311
40:48,488 --> 40:52,318
10 Hertz means to go 10 times around per second.

312
40:53,298 --> 41:07,828
And then we identify Omega, the angular velocity Omega, which is in radians per second.

313
41:09,418 --> 41:17,568
Since it takes T seconds to go around 2 pi radians, Omega is 2 pi divided by T.

314
41:19,118 --> 41:36,208
Now then we have the speed, which we can also think of as a linear velocity, how many meters per second is linear as opposed to how many radians per second, which is angular velocity. So this is a linear velocity, this is an angular velocity.

315
41:36,778 --> 41:50,218
And that linear velocity, which in this case is really a speed, is of course the circumference of the circle divided by how many seconds it takes to go around.

316
41:50,498 --> 41:52,408
And that is also Omega R.

317
41:52,728 --> 41:53,748
And that is now in meters per second.

318
41:55,128 --> 42:01,908
All this is only possible if there is an acceleration.

319
42:02,488 --> 42:05,878
And the acceleration is called the centripetal acceleration.

320
42:06,668 --> 42:10,628
It is always pointed towards the center.

321
42:12,428 --> 42:18,488
A centripetal, A centripetal.

322
42:19,458 --> 42:27,308
And the centripetal acceleration, the magnitude is V2 divided by R.

323
42:27,818 --> 42:34,548
Which is therefore also omega square R. And that of course is in meters per second square.

324
42:40,768 --> 42:59,548
I want to work out a specific example and the example that I have chosen is the human centrifuge that is used by NASA in Houston for experiments

325
42:59,898 --> 43:07,238
on humans to see how they deal with strong accelerations.

326
43:08,118 --> 43:15,568
This is that centrifuge.

327
43:17,118 --> 43:28,598
The radius from the axis of rotation, the axis of rotation is here, and the distance from here to here, though you may not think so, is about 15 m.

328
43:28,858 --> 43:32,678
So the astronauts go in here, and then this thing goes around.

329
43:33,748 --> 43:39,738
And so I would like to work out this with some some numbers.

330
43:42,298 --> 43:43,078
Okay.

331
43:44,758 --> 43:46,138
All right.

332
43:47,138 --> 43:54,338
The radius R, I'll give you light back, because that may be nicer for you.

333
43:55,058 --> 44:01,328
The radius is 15 m. Depends of course a little bit on where the person is located in that sphere.

334
44:01,858 --> 44:14,198
It goes around 24 revolutions per minute, and that translates into 0.4 hertz.

335
44:14,878 --> 44:20,108
So the period to go around for one rotation is 2 and 1/2 seconds.

336
44:20,948 --> 44:23,608
thing goes around once in 2 and 1/2 seconds.

337
44:24,668 --> 44:39,368
So the angular velocity omega, which is 2 pi divided by T, if you take 2 pi and divide it by 2 and 1/2, it just comes out to be roughly 2 and 1/2, which is purely accident, but that's the way it is.

338
44:39,578 --> 44:46,818
Don't ever think that that has to be the same, of course. It just happens to come out that way for these dimensions.

339
44:46,818 --> 44:49,858
So omega is about 2 and 1/2 radians per second.

340
44:50,248 --> 45:10,528
And the speed, the linear speed, tangential speed, if you want to call it, is omega R. That comes out to be about 35 37.7 m per second.

341
45:11,308 --> 45:16,378
And that translates into about 85 mph. So it's a sizable speed.

342
45:18,188 --> 45:39,778
What of course the goal is for NASA, what is the centripetal acceleration, that is omega square R, or if you prefer to take V square divided by R, you find of course exactly the same answer if you haven't made a slip, and that is 95 m per second squared.

343
45:40,378 --> 45:46,368
And that is about 10 times the gravitational acceleration on Earth, which is really phenomenal.

344
45:47,098 --> 45:57,168
If you add to the fact that the direction is changing all the time when you go around, so you feel the 10 G in this direction, and then you feel it in a different direction.

345
45:57,168 --> 46:03,268
I can't imagine how people can actually survive that. I mean, not faint.

346
46:03,878 --> 46:17,618
Most people like you and me, if we were to be accelerated along a straight line, not even a circle where the direction changes, but along a straight line, most of us faint when we get close to 6G.

347
46:18,088 --> 46:26,218
And there is a reason for that. Uh you get problems with your blood circulation and uh not enough oxygen goes to your brains. And that's why you faint.

348
46:27,268 --> 46:33,108
How these astronauts can do it at 10G and the direction changing all the time, it beats me.

349
46:33,648 --> 46:35,858
If you take a Boeing 747,

350
46:36,468 --> 46:41,268
it takes 30 seconds from the moment that it starts on the runway until it takes off.

351
46:41,268 --> 46:42,738
You should time that when you get a chance.

352
46:42,738 --> 46:44,378
It's very close to 30 seconds.

353
46:44,728 --> 46:49,848
And by that time, the plane has reached a speed of about 150 mph.

354
46:50,778 --> 46:59,448
And if you calculate, if you assume that the acceleration is constant, it's an easy calculation, it turns out that the acceleration is only 2 meters per second squared.

355
46:59,838 --> 47:02,778
There's only 1/5th of the gravitational acceleration.

356
47:03,208 --> 47:14,238
It feels sort of good, right? It's very comfortable when you're sort of taking off, but it's only 2 meters per second square. These poor people, men and women, 95 meters per second square.

357
47:19,488 --> 47:27,618
I would like to address something that is not part of the exam, but that is something that I want you to think about, something that is fun.

358
47:28,258 --> 47:31,608
And it's always nice to do something that is fun.

359
47:32,878 --> 47:34,718
It has to do with my last lecture.

360
47:35,128 --> 47:42,858
I have to clean my hands first for it to work quite well.

361
47:43,468 --> 47:45,948
I have a a yard stick here.

362
47:46,688 --> 47:53,688
And I'm going to put the yard stick on my hands, on my two fingers, which I hold in front of me.

363
47:54,178 --> 47:55,438
Here it is.

364
47:57,138 --> 47:59,138
It's resting on my two fingers.

365
48:00,728 --> 48:05,568
And I'm going to move my two fingers towards each other.

366
48:06,368 --> 48:10,848
One of them begins to slide first. Of course, I can't tell you which one.

367
48:11,368 --> 48:14,188
But something very strange will happen.

368
48:15,768 --> 48:24,088
If this one starts to slide first, it comes to a stop, and then the other one starts to slide and it comes to a stop, and then this one starts to slide, and so on.

369
48:24,808 --> 48:25,918
And that is very strange.

370
48:26,288 --> 48:32,948
This is something you should be able to explain, certainly after the lecture we had last time.

371
48:33,378 --> 48:34,608
Look at this.

372
48:38,098 --> 48:45,048
Did you see the alternation? I'll do it a little faster. Left is going, right is going, left is going, right is going, left is going. Once more.

373
48:45,988 --> 48:51,748
Look at it. Left is going, right is going, left is going, right is going. They alternate.

374
48:52,668 --> 48:54,278
Give this some thought.

375
48:54,928 --> 49:05,088
And you know, Pivot has an option that you can discuss problems with other students. So make use of this discussion button and see whether you can come to an explanation.

376
49:05,628 --> 49:09,188
Good luck on your exam. See you next Friday.
