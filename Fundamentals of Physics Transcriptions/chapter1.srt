00:00:200 --> 00:03:640
I'm Walter Lewin. I will be your lecturer this term.

2
00:04:890 --> 00:10:120
In physics, we explore the very small to the very large.

3
00:10:210 --> 00:16:130
The very small is a small fraction of a proton, and the very large is the universe itself.

4
00:16:680 --> 00:24:100
They span 45 orders of magnitude. A one with 45 zeros.

5
00:25:110 --> 00:31:120
To express measurements quantitatively, we have to introduce units.

6
00:31:440 --> 00:46:320
And we introduce for the unit of length, the meter, for the unit of time, the second, and for the unit of mass, the kilogram.

7
00:46:890 --> 00:52:950
And you can read in your book how these are defined and how the definition evolved historically.

8
00:53:940 --> 01:02:100
Now, there are many derived units which we use in our daily life for convenience, and some are tailored to a specific fields.

9
01:02:710 --> 01:10:160
We have centimeters, we have millimeters, kilometers. We have inches, feet, miles.

10
01:10:510 --> 01:20:520
Astronomers even use the astronomical unit, which is the mean distance between the Earth and the sun, and they use light years, which is the distance that light travels in one year.

11
01:21:730 --> 01:29:30
We have milliseconds, we have microseconds, we have days, weeks, hours, centuries, months, all derived units.

12
01:29:630 --> 01:39:800
For the mass, we have milligrams, we have pounds, we have metric tons. So lots of derived units exist.

13
01:40:310 --> 02:05:990
Not all of them are very easy to work with. I find it extremely difficult to work with inches and feet. It's an extremely uncivilized system. I don't mean to insult you, but think about it. 12 inches in a foot, 3 feet in a yard, that drives you nuts. I work almost exclusively decimal, and I hope you will do the same during this course, but we may make some exceptions.

14
02:06:260 --> 02:10:550
I will now first show you a movie which is called the Powers of 10.

15
02:10:990 --> 02:18:960
It covers 40 orders of magnitude. It was originally conceived by a Dutchman named Kees Boeke in the early 50s.

16
02:19:430 --> 02:30:190
This is the second generation movie, and you will hear the voice of Professor Morrison, who is a professor at MIT.

17
02:30:660 --> 02:38:920
The Powers of 10, 40 orders of magnitude. There we go.

18
02:40:470 --> 02:50:690
I already introduced, as you see there, length, time and mass. And we call these the three fundamental quantities in physics.

19
02:51:270 --> 02:58:890
I will give this the symbol capital L for length, capital T for time, and capital M for mass.

20
02:58:890 --> 03:04:480
Many other quantities in physics can be derived from these fundamental quantities.

21
03:04:920 --> 03:11:240
I give you an example. I put a bracket around here. I say speed.

22
03:11:710 --> 03:19:280
And that means the dimensions of speed. The dimensions of speed is the dimension of length divided by the dimension of time.

23
03:19:280 --> 03:31:130
So I can write for that bracket L divided by bracket T. Whether it's meters per second or inches per year, that's not what matters. It has the dimension length per time.

24
03:31:700 --> 03:41:280
Volume would have the dimension of length to the power of three.

25
03:41:840 --> 03:54:210
Density would have the dimension of mass per unit volume. So that means length to the power three.

26
03:54:770 --> 04:08:140
All important in our course is acceleration. We will deal a lot with acceleration. Acceleration, as you will see, is length per time squared. The unit is meters per second squared.

27
04:08:550 --> 04:16:150
So you get length divided by time squared.

28
04:16:740 --> 04:21:830
So all other quantities can be derived from these three fundamental.

29
04:22:150 --> 04:30:230
So now that we have agreed on the units, we have the meter, the second and the kilogram, we can start making measurements.

30
04:30:230 --> 04:39:270
Now, all important in making measurements, which is always ignored in every college book, is the uncertainty in your measurement.

31
04:39:880 --> 04:47:100
Any measurement that you make without any knowledge of the uncertainty is meaningless.

32
04:47:690 --> 04:59:870
I will repeat this. I want you to hear it tonight at 3:00 when you wake up. Any measurement that you make without a knowledge of its uncertainty is completely meaningless.

33
05:01:240 --> 05:12:220
My grandmother used to tell me that, at least she believed it, that someone who is lying in bed is longer than someone who stands up.

34
05:13:240 --> 05:18:020
And in honor of my grandmother, I'm going to bring this today to a test.

35
05:18:620 --> 05:25:220
I have here a setup where I can measure a person standing up and a person lying down.

36
05:25:700 --> 05:28:450
It's not the greatest bed, but lying down.

37
05:28:790 --> 05:36:140
I have to convince you about the uncertainty in my measurements because a measurement without knowledge of the uncertainty is meaningless.

38
05:36:480 --> 05:52:430
And therefore, what I will do is the following. I have here an aluminum bar, and I make the reasonable plausible assumption that when this aluminum bar is sleeping, when it is horizontal, that it is not longer than when it is standing up.

39
05:52:740 --> 06:02:150
If you accept that, we can compare the length of this aluminum bar with this setup and with this setup, at least we have some kind of calibration to start with.

40
06:02:700 --> 06:16:180
I will measure it. You have to trust me. During these three months, we have to trust each other. So, I measure here 149.9 centimeters.

41
06:16:640 --> 06:32:300
However, I would think that the, so this is the aluminum bar. This is in vertical position, 149.9, but I would think that the uncertainty of my measurement is probably 1 millimeter.

42
06:32:690 --> 06:35:340
I can't really guarantee you that I did it accurately any better.

43
06:35:690 --> 06:38:150
So that's the vertical one.

44
06:38:490 --> 06:51:460
Now, we're going to measure the bar horizontally, for which we have a setup here. Ooh, the scale is on your side. So now I measure the length of this bar. 150.0.

45
06:53:470 --> 07:09:080
Horizontally, 150.0, again, plus or minus 0.1 cm. So you would agree with me that I am capable of measuring plus or minus 1 millimeter. That's the uncertainty of my measurement.

46
07:10:010 --> 07:20:140
Now, if the difference in lengths between lying down and standing up, if that were one foot, we would all know it, wouldn't we?

47
07:20:480 --> 07:25:130
You get out of bed in the morning, you lie down, you get up and you go clunk, and you're one foot shorter.

48
07:25:320 --> 07:31:220
And we know that that's not the case. If the difference were only 1 millimeter, we would never know.

49
07:31:820 --> 07:39:180
Therefore, I suspect that if my grandmother was right, that it's probably only a few centimeters, maybe an inch.

50
07:39:540 --> 07:47:080
And so I would argue that if I can measure the length of a student to 1 millimeter accuracy, that should settle the issue.

51
07:47:690 --> 07:49:120
So, I need a volunteer.

52
07:51:010 --> 07:57:190
You want to volunteer? Looks like you're very tall. I hope that, yeah. I hope we can I hope that we we don't run out of

53
07:57:190 --> 08:01:490
You're not taller than 178 or so?

54
08:01:490 --> 08:04:990
I hope not. What is your name? Rick Rider. Rick, Rick Rider.

55
08:05:490 --> 08:07:360
You're not nervous, right? No.

56
08:08:400 --> 08:16:310
Man. Sit down. I can't have tall guys here. Come on.

57
08:17:290 --> 08:20:460
We need someone more modest in size.

58
08:21:720 --> 08:23:310
Don't take it personal, Rick.

59
08:24:320 --> 08:28:260
Okay. What is your name? Zach. Zach.

60
08:29:600 --> 08:32:160
Nice day today, Zach. Yeah.

61
08:32:790 --> 08:35:600
You feel all right? First lecture at MIT?

62
08:35:960 --> 08:37:590
I don't. Okay, man.

63
08:40:460 --> 08:49:010
Stand there. Yeah. Okay. 183.2.

64
08:49:460 --> 08:51:270
Stay there. Stay there. Don't move.

65
08:51:650 --> 09:00:270
Zach. Uh, this is vertical. What did I say? 183? Only one person.

66
09:02:510 --> 09:03:550
Three.

67
09:04:740 --> 09:06:580
Come on.

68
09:07:610 --> 09:14:070
.2? .2. Okay. 183.2. Yeah.

69
09:14:620 --> 09:23:430
And an uncertainty of about 1. Oh, this is centimeters. 0.1 cm.

70
09:24:040 --> 09:27:410
And now we're going to measure him horizontally.

71
09:28:550 --> 09:46:070
Zach, I don't want you to break your bones. So we have a little step step for you here. Put your feet there. Oh, let me remove the aluminum bar. Don't watch out for the scale, that you don't break that because then it's all over. Okay.

72
09:46:070 --> 10:03:750
I'll come on your side. I have to do that. Yeah, yeah. Relax. Think of this as a small sacrifice for the sake of science, right? You good? You comfortable? Wonderful. Okay.

73
10:05:000 --> 10:10:460
You ready? Yes. Okay.

74
10:12:500 --> 10:15:910
185.7.

75
10:15:910 --> 10:28:050
Stay where you are. 185.7. I'm sure I want to make the subtraction, right? 185.7 plus or minus 0.1 cm.

76
10:28:490 --> 10:39:240
Oh, that is five. That is 2.5 plus or minus 0.2 cm. You're about 1 inch taller when you sleep than when you stand up. My grandmother was right.

77
10:39:560 --> 10:42:630
She's always right. Can you get off here?

78
10:43:530 --> 10:51:170
I want you to appreciate that the accuracy, thank you very much, Zach, that the accuracy of 1 millimeter was more than sufficient to make the case.

79
10:51:170 --> 10:58:130
If the accuracy in my measurement would have been much less, this measurement would not have been convincing at all.

80
10:58:610 --> 11:04:580
So whenever you make a measurement, you must know the uncertainty, otherwise it is meaningless.

81
11:05:600 --> 11:15:600
Galileo Galilei asked himself the question, why are mammals as large as they are and not much larger.

82
11:16:510 --> 11:21:300
He had a very clever reasoning, which I've never seen in print.

83
11:21:590 --> 11:28:410
But it comes down to the fact that he argued that if the mammal becomes too massive, that the bones will break.

84
11:28:820 --> 11:31:480
And he thought that that was a limiting factor.

85
11:32:380 --> 11:39:060
Even though I've never seen his reasoning in print, I will try to reconstruct it what could have gone through his head.

86
11:39:420 --> 11:47:430
Here is a mammal. And this is the one of the four legs of the mammal.

87
11:48:350 --> 11:57:250
And this mammal has a size S. And what I mean by that is

88
11:57:620 --> 12:02:280
a mouse is yay big, and a cat is yay big. That's what I mean by size.

89
12:02:790 --> 12:05:300
Very crudely defined.

90
12:06:220 --> 12:09:000
The mass of the mammal is M.

91
12:09:810 --> 12:22:320
And this mammal has a thigh bone, which we call the femur, which is here. And the femur, of course, carries the body to a large extent.

92
12:22:320 --> 12:26:760
And let's assume that the femur has a length L and has a thickness D.

93
12:27:410 --> 12:34:610
Here is a femur. This is what a femur approximately looks like.

94
12:37:700 --> 12:43:420
So, this would be the length of the femur.

95
12:45:160 --> 12:48:180
And this would be the thickness D.

96
12:48:700 --> 12:54:020
And this would be the cross-sectional area A.

97
12:55:380 --> 13:03:080
I'm now going to take you through what we call in physics a scaling argument.

98
13:04:840 --> 13:12:180
I would argue that the length of the femur must be proportional to the size of the animal. That's completely plausible.

99
13:12:180 --> 13:17:430
If an animal is four times larger than another, you would need four times longer legs. That's all this is saying.

100
13:17:820 --> 13:19:140
It's very reasonable.

101
13:21:110 --> 13:41:910
It is also very reasonable that the mass of an animal is proportional to the third power of the size because that's related to its volume. And so if it's related to the third power of the size, it must also be proportional to the third power of the length of the femur because of this relationship.

102
13:42:690 --> 13:44:270
Okay, that's one.

103
13:45:290 --> 14:01:360
Now comes the argument. Pressure on the femur is proportional to the weight of the animal divided by the cross-section A of the femur.

104
14:01:660 --> 14:03:060
That's what pressure is.

105
14:03:480 --> 14:13:440
And that is the mass of the animal, that's proportional to the mass of the animal divided by d squared. because we want the area here. It's proportional to d squared.

106
14:14:300 --> 14:16:180
Now follow me closely.

107
14:17:710 --> 14:24:400
If the pressure is higher than a certain level, the bones will break.

108
14:25:270 --> 14:43:010
Therefore, for an animal not to break its bones, when the mass goes up by a certain factor, say a factor of four, in order for the bones not to break, d squared must also go up by a factor of four. That's a key argument in the scaling here. You really have to think that through carefully.

109
14:43:410 --> 14:49:060
Therefore, I would argue that the mass must be proportional to D squared.

110
14:49:380 --> 14:53:180
This is the breaking argument. Now, compare these two.

111
14:53:180 --> 15:13:810
The mass is proportional to the length of the femur to the power 3 and to the thickness of the femur to the power two. Therefore, the thickness of the femur to the power two must be proportional to the length L to the power three. And therefore, the thickness of the femur must be proportional to L to the power 3 halves.

112
15:14:200 --> 15:20:000
A very interesting result. What is this result telling you?

113
15:20:570 --> 15:38:060
It tells you that if I have two animals, and one is 10 times larger than the other, that S is 10 times larger, that the length of the legs are 10 times larger, but that the thickness of the femur is 30 times larger.

114
15:38:430 --> 15:57:240
Because it is L to the power 3 halves. If I were to compare a mouse with an elephant, an elephant is about 100 times larger in size. So the length of the femur of the elephant would be 100 times larger than that of a mouse. But the thickness of the femur would have to be 1,000 times larger.

115
15:57:710 --> 16:07:000
And that may have convinced Galileo Galilei that that's the reason why the largest animals are as large as they are.

116
16:07:000 --> 16:19:080
Because clearly, if you increase the mass, there comes a time that the thickness of the bones is the same as the length of the bones. You're all made of bone and that is biologically not feasible.

117
16:19:450 --> 16:23:140
And so there is a limit somewhere set by this scaling law.

118
16:25:200 --> 16:28:390
Well, I I wanted to bring this to a test.

119
16:28:390 --> 16:34:980
After all, I brought my grandmother's statement to a test, so why not bringing Galileo Galilei's statement to a test.

120
16:35:340 --> 16:47:590
And so, I went to Harvard where they have a beautiful collection of femurs. And I asked them for the femur of a raccoon and a horse.

121
16:48:290 --> 17:03:660
A raccoon is this big. A horse is about four times bigger. So the length of the femur of a horse must be about four times the length of the raccoon. Close.

122
17:03:660 --> 17:05:150
So I was not surprised.

123
17:05:940 --> 17:19:710
Then I measured the thickness and I said to myself, haha, if the length is four times higher, then the thickness has to be eight times higher if this holds.

124
17:19:920 --> 17:27:110
And what I'm going to plot for you, you will see that shortly, is D divided by L versus L.

125
17:27:110 --> 17:32:300
And that of course must be proportional to L to the power one half.

126
17:32:670 --> 17:46:380
So, if I compare the horse and I compare the raccoon, I would argue that the thickness divided by the length of the femur for the horse must be the square root of four twice as much as that of the raccoon.

127
17:47:230 --> 17:51:400
And so I was very anxious to plot that. And I did that.

128
17:51:940 --> 17:54:090
And I'll show you the result.

129
17:55:040 --> 17:58:010
Here is my first result.

130
18:01:680 --> 18:11:330
So, we see there D over L. I explained to you why I preferred to plot it. And here you see the length. You see here the raccoon and you see the horse.

131
18:11:330 --> 18:20:120
And if you look carefully, then the D over L for the horse is only about 1 and a half times larger than the raccoon. Well, I wasn't too disappointed.

132
18:20:630 --> 18:28:090
1 and a half is not two, but it is in the right direction. The horse clearly have a larger value for D over L than the raccoon.

133
18:28:360 --> 18:31:060
I realized I needed more data.

134
18:31:060 --> 18:38:070
So I went back to Harvard. I said, look, I need smaller animal, an opossum, maybe, maybe a rat, maybe a mouse.

135
18:38:070 --> 18:42:040
And they said, okay. They gave me three more bones.

136
18:42:700 --> 18:46:120
They gave me an antelope, which is actually a little larger than the raccoon.

137
18:46:450 --> 18:51:030
And they gave me an opossum, and they gave me a mouth.

138
18:52:360 --> 18:58:970
Here is the bone of the antelope.

139
19:00:600 --> 19:05:760
Here is the one of the raccoon.

140
19:06:220 --> 19:09:220
Here is the one of the opossum.

141
19:09:780 --> 19:18:880
And now you won't believe this. This is so wonderful, so romantic. There is the mouse.

142
19:20:290 --> 19:25:570
Isn't that beautiful? Teenny weeny little mouse, it's only a teeny weeny little femur.

143
19:26:730 --> 19:28:720
And there it is.

144
19:30:040 --> 19:40:710
And I I made the plot. I was very curious what that plot would look like. And here it is.

145
19:45:740 --> 19:47:900
I was shocked.

146
19:48:490 --> 19:50:800
I was really shocked.

147
19:51:370 --> 19:56:300
Because look, the horse is 50 times larger in size than the mouse.

148
19:56:650 --> 20:05:310
The difference in D over L is only a factor of two. And I expected something more like a factor of seven.

149
20:05:810 --> 20:11:080
And so, in D over L where I expect the factor of seven, I only see a factor of two.

150
20:11:450 --> 20:25:350
So I said to myself, oh my goodness, why didn't I ask them for an elephant? The real clincher would be the elephant because if that goes way off scale, maybe we can still rescue the statement by Galileo Galilei."

151
20:25:350 --> 20:36:350
And so I went back and they said, okay, we'll give you the femur of an elephant. They also gave me one of a moose, believe it or not. I think they wanted to get rid of me by that time to be frank of you. And here is the femur of an elephant.

152
20:40:740 --> 20:49:310
And I measured it, the length and the thickness. And it is very heavy. It weighs a ton.

153
20:50:450 --> 20:58:080
I plotted it. I was full of expectation. I couldn't sleep all night. And there's the elephant.

154
20:58:630 --> 21:04:640
There is no evidence whatsoever that D over L is really larger for the elephant than for the mouth.

155
21:04:970 --> 21:19:980
These vertical bars indicate my uncertainties in measurements of thickness, and the horizontal scale, which is a logarithmic scale, the uncertainty of the length measurements is in the thickness of the red pen, so there's no need for me to indicate that any further.

156
21:20:590 --> 21:24:270
And here you have your measurements in case you want to check them.

157
21:24:750 --> 21:27:620
And look again at the mouth and look at the elephant.

158
21:28:490 --> 21:46:060
The mouth has indeed only 1 cm length of the femur, and the elephant is indeed 100 times longer. So the first scaling argument that S is proportional to L, that is certainly what you expect because an elephant is about 100 times larger in size.

159
21:46:450 --> 22:06:590
But when you go to D over L, you see it's all over. The D over L for the mouth is really not all that different from the elephant. And you would have expected that number to be with the square root of 100, so you would expect it to be 10 times larger instead of about the same.

160
22:07:490 --> 22:14:160
I now want to discuss with you what we call in physics dimensional analysis.

161
22:16:210 --> 22:31:900
I want to ask myself the question, if I drop an apple from a certain height and I change that height, what will happen with the time for the apple to fall?

162
22:34:300 --> 22:44:300
Well, I dropped the apple from an height H, and I want to know what happens with the time when it falls. And I change H.

163
22:45:720 --> 22:52:610
So, I said to myself, well, the time that it takes must be proportional to the height to some power alpha.

164
22:52:970 --> 23:00:200
It's completely reasonable. If I make the height larger, we all know that it takes longer for the apple to fall. That's a safe thing.

165
23:00:860 --> 23:09:060
I said to myself, well, if the apple has a mass M, it probably is also proportional to the mass of that apple to the power beta.

166
23:09:530 --> 23:17:530
I said to myself, Gee, yeah, if something is more massive, it will probably take more time. So, maybe M to some power beta. I don't know alpha, I don't know beta.

167
23:20:120 --> 23:39:130
And then I said, yeah, there is also something like gravity. There is the earth's gravitational pull, the gravitational acceleration of the earth. So let's introduce that too. And let's assume that that time is also proportional to the gravitational acceleration. This is an acceleration, we'll learn a lot more about that, to the power gamma.

168
23:40:730 --> 23:47:560
Having said this, we can now do what's called in physics a dimensional analysis.

169
23:51:780 --> 23:54:390
On the left, we have a time.

170
23:54:890 --> 24:08:800
And if we have a left on the left side a time, on the right side, we must also have time. You cannot have coconuts on one side and oranges on the other. You cannot have seconds on one side and meters per second on the other.

171
24:09:190 --> 24:18:320
So the dimensions left and right have to be the same. What is the dimension here? That is T to the power 1. It's that T.

172
24:19:000 --> 24:45:530
That must be the same as length to the power alpha times mass to the power beta times acceleration, remember it is still there on the blackboard, has dimension L divided by times squared. And the whole thing to the power gamma, so I have a gamma here, I have a gamma there.

173
24:45:990 --> 24:51:130
This side must have the same dimension as that side. That is non-negotiable in physics.

174
24:52:030 --> 24:58:610
Okay, there we go. There is no M here. There is only one M here. So beta must be zero.

175
25:00:350 --> 25:10:660
There is here L to the power alpha, L to the power gamma. There is no L here. So L must disappear. So alpha plus gamma must be zero.

176
25:11:600 --> 25:19:280
There is T to the power 1 here, and there is here t to the power minus 2 gamma. It's minus because it's downstairs.

177
25:19:690 --> 25:26:350
So 1 must be equal to minus 2 gamma. That means gamma must be minus 1/2.

178
25:26:770 --> 25:33:450
But if gamma is minus 1/2, then alpha equals plus 1/2.

179
25:34:720 --> 25:37:170
End of my dimensional analysis.

180
25:37:660 --> 25:57:290
I therefore conclude that the time that it takes for an object to fall equals some constant, which I do not know. But that constant has no dimension. I don't know what it is. times the square root of H divided by g.

181
25:58:350 --> 26:14:230
Beta is zero. There is no mass. H to the power one half. You see that here. And g to the power minus one half. This is proportional to the square root of H because g is a given and C is a given, even though I don't know C.

182
26:14:790 --> 26:19:110
I made no pretense that I can predict how long it will take for the apple to fall.

183
26:19:810 --> 26:38:500
All I'm saying is, I can compare two different heights. I can drop an apple from 8 m and another one from 2 m, and the one from 8 m will take two times longer than the one from 2 m. The square root of 8 to 2, 4 over 2 will take two times longer, right?

184
26:38:820 --> 26:53:420
If I drop one from 8 m and I drop another one from 2 m, then the difference in time will be the square root of the ratio that will be twice as long. And that I want to bring to a test today.

185
26:54:550 --> 27:17:600
We have a setup here. We have an apple there at a height of 3 m. We know that actually the the length to an accuracy, the height to an accuracy of about 3 mm, no better. And here we have a setup whereby the apple is about 1 and 1/2 m above the ground. And we know that to about also an accuracy of no better than about 3 mm.

186
27:18:630 --> 27:31:080
So, let's set this up. I have here something that's going to be a prediction of the time that it takes for one apple to fall divided by the time that it takes for the other apple to fall.

187
27:39:220 --> 27:47:530
H1 is 3 m. But I claim there is an uncertainty of about 3 mm.

188
27:47:930 --> 27:58:840
Can't do any better. And H2 equals 1.5 m. Again, with an uncertainty of about 3 mm.

189
28:00:800 --> 28:16:470
The ratio H1 over H2 is 2.000. And now I have to come up with an uncertainty, which physicists sometimes call an error in their measurements, but it's really an uncertainty.

190
28:16:770 --> 28:36:390
And the way you find the uncertainty is that you add the three here, and you subtract the three here, then you get the largest value possible. You can never get a larger value, and you'll find that you get 2.006. So, I would say the uncertainty is then 006.

191
28:36:870 --> 28:41:600
This is a dimensionless number because it's length divided by length.

192
28:42:160 --> 28:55:660
And so the time T1 divided by T2 would be the square root of H1 divided by H2. That is the dimensional analysis argument that we have there.

193
28:55:930 --> 29:06:640
And we find, if we take the square root of this number, we find 1.414 plus or minus 0.002.

194
29:08:130 --> 29:16:960
Here is a firm prediction. And now we're going to make an observation.

195
29:22:500 --> 29:34:030
So we're going to measure T1, there's going to be a number. And then we're going to measure T2. There's going to be a number.

196
29:34:420 --> 29:41:260
I have done this experiment 10 times and the numbers always reproduce within about 1 millisecond.

197
29:41:560 --> 29:44:330
So I could just adopt an uncertainty of 1 millisecond.

198
29:44:330 --> 29:57:200
I want to be a little bit on the safe side. Occasionally it differs by 2 milliseconds. So let us be conservative and let's assume that I can measure this to an accuracy of about 2 milliseconds.

199
29:57:540 --> 29:59:130
That is pretty safe.

200
30:00:550 --> 30:10:760
So, now we can measure these times. And then we can take the ratio. And then we can see whether we actually confirm that the time that it takes is proportional

201
30:13:010 --> 30:17:760
to the height to the square root of the height.

202
30:18:550 --> 30:38:210
So, I will make it a little more comfortable for you in the lecture hall. That's all right. We have the setup here.

203
30:38:210 --> 30:44:110
We first do the experiment with the 3 meters. There you see the 3 meters.

204
30:44:110 --> 30:53:240
And the time, the moment that I pull this string, the apple will fall. A contact will open, the clock will start. The moment that it hits the floor, the time will stop.

205
30:53:810 --> 30:59:190
I have to stand on that side, otherwise the apple will fall on my hand. That's not the idea.

206
31:00:320 --> 31:04:110
Stand here. You ready?

207
31:04:370 --> 31:05:980
Okay, then I'm ready.

208
31:06:940 --> 31:11:490
Everything set? Make sure that I've zeroed that button. Yes, I have.

209
31:12:540 --> 31:17:020
Okay. 3, 2, 1, 0.

210
31:18:330 --> 31:21:750
781 milliseconds.

211
31:22:300 --> 31:33:000
So this number, you should write it down because you will need it for your second assignment. 781 milliseconds with an uncertainty of 2 milliseconds.

212
31:33:600 --> 31:36:260
We ready for the second one?

213
31:39:610 --> 31:41:360
You ready?

214
31:41:360 --> 31:42:280
Ready?

215
31:42:640 --> 31:46:990
Okay, nothing wrong with being ready.

216
31:48:870 --> 31:53:610
00, right? 00? Thank you.

217
31:54:670 --> 31:58:360
Okay. 3, 2, 1, 0.

218
32:00:420 --> 32:03:910
551 milliseconds.

219
32:05:830 --> 32:12:530
Boy, I'm nervous because I hope that physics works.

220
32:13:450 --> 32:23:920
So, I take my calculator and I'm now going to take the ratio T1 over T2.

221
32:24:420 --> 32:36:450
The uncertainty you can find by adding the two here and subtracting the two there, then that will then give you an uncertainty of, I think 0.00 0.08. Yeah.

222
32:38:800 --> 32:46:410
0.08. You should do that for yourself. 0.008. Dimensionless number. This would be the uncertainty.

223
32:47:110 --> 32:48:830
This is the observation.

224
32:50:110 --> 33:08:020
781 divided by 551. 14 17.

225
33:09:170 --> 33:11:420
Perfect agreement.

226
33:11:760 --> 33:22:560
Look, the prediction says 1.414, but it could be 1 point could be two higher. That's the uncertainty in my height. I don't know any better.

227
33:22:990 --> 33:28:420
And here, I could even be off by an eight, because that's the uncertainty in my timing.

228
33:28:760 --> 33:36:070
So these two measurements confirm, they are in agreement with each other. If you see uncertainties in measurements are essential.

229
33:37:240 --> 33:43:910
Now look at our results.

230
33:45:290 --> 33:50:090
We have here a result which is striking.

231
33:50:720 --> 33:58:150
We have demonstrated that the time that it takes for an object to fall is independent of its mass.

232
33:59:890 --> 34:02:920
That is an amazing accomplishment.

233
34:04:240 --> 34:13:210
Our grand our great grandfathers must have worried about this and argued about this for more than 300 years.

234
34:14:430 --> 34:21:820
Were they so dumb to overlook this simple dimensional analysis?

235
34:22:090 --> 34:25:370
Inconceivable.

236
34:26:640 --> 34:32:860
Is this dimensional analysis perhaps not quite kosher? Maybe.

237
34:33:450 --> 34:42:100
Is this dimensional analysis perhaps one that could have been done differently?

238
34:42:560 --> 34:43:830
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

239
34:44:420 --> 34:46:580
You could have done it very differently.

240
34:46:910 --> 34:57:180
You could have said the following. You could have said, the time for an apple to fall is proportional

241
34:57:610 --> 35:05:700
to the height that it falls from to the power alpha. Very reasonable. We all know the higher it is, the more it will take, the more time it will take.

242
35:06:540 --> 35:17:830
And we could have said, yeah, it's probably proportional to the mass somehow. If the mass is more, it will take a little bit less time. turns out to be not so, but you can think that.

243
35:18:220 --> 35:24:260
But you could have said, well, let's not take the acceleration of the earth, but let's take the mass of the earth itself.

244
35:24:660 --> 35:30:380
Very reasonable, right? I would think if I increase the mass of the earth, that the apple will fall faster.

245
35:30:870 --> 35:41:100
So now I would put in the mass of the earth here. And I start my dimensional analysis and I end up dead in the waters.

246
35:41:530 --> 35:49:700
Because you see there is no mass here. There is a mass to the power beta here and one to the power gamma.

247
35:49:700 --> 35:56:920
So what you would have found is beta plus gamma equals zero, and that would be end of story.

248
35:57:870 --> 36:06:790
Now you can ask yourself the question, well, is there something wrong with the analysis that we did? Is ours perhaps better than this one?

249
36:07:530 --> 36:08:870
Well, it's a different one.

250
36:09:580 --> 36:14:470
We came to the conclusion that the time that it takes for the apple to fall is independent of the mass.

251
36:15:120 --> 36:17:280
Do we believe that?

252
36:17:640 --> 36:18:820
Yes, we do.

253
36:19:880 --> 36:44:030
On the other hand, there are very prestigious physicists who even nowadays do very fancy experiments and they try to demonstrate that the time for an apple to fall does depend on its mass. Even though it probably is only very small if it's true, but they try to prove that. And if any of them succeeds or any one of you succeeds, that's certainly worth a Nobel prize.

254
36:44:430 --> 36:47:910
So we do believe that it's independent of the mass.

255
36:48:350 --> 36:56:040
However, this what I did with you was not a proof because if you do it this way, you get stuck.

256
36:56:630 --> 37:07:460
On the other hand, I'm quite pleased with the fact that we found that the time is proportional with the square root of H. I think that's very useful. We confirmed that with experiment, and indeed it came out that way.

257
37:07:840 --> 37:14:070
So, it was not a complete waste of time. But when you do an dimensional analysis, you better be careful.

258
37:17:500 --> 37:31:040
I like you to think this over, the comparison between the two, at dinner, and maybe at breakfast, and maybe even while you're taking a shower, whether it's needed or not.

259
37:31:640 --> 37:45:310
It is important that you digest and appreciate the difference between these two approaches. It will give you an insight in the power and also into the limitations of dimensional analysis.

260
37:45:710 --> 37:50:400
This goes to the very heart of our understanding and appreciation of physics.

261
37:51:030 --> 37:53:550
It's important that you get a feel for this.

262
37:54:550 --> 37:57:940
You're now at MIT. This is the time.

263
37:58:450 --> 38:00:660
Thank you. See you Friday.
