00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:01,851
Last time,

2
00:00:04,344 --> 00:00:13,024
we discussed that an acceleration is caused by a push or by a pool.

3
00:00:13,858 --> 00:00:20,928
Today we will express this more quantitatively in three laws which are called Newton's laws.

4
00:00:21,508 --> 00:00:32,808
The first law really goes back to the first first part of the 17th century, which was Galileo who expressed what he called the law of inertia.

5
00:00:32,808 --> 00:00:34,948
And I will read you this law.

6
00:00:37,068 --> 00:00:52,528
A body at rest remains at rest, and a body in motion continues to move at constant velocity along a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.

7
00:00:53,478 --> 00:00:59,458
And now I will read to you Newton's own words in his famous book Principia.

8
01:00,848 --> 01:19,868
Everybody perseveres in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a right line unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it.

9
01:20,718 --> 01:24,738
Now Newton's first law is clearly against our daily experiences.

10
01:24,978 --> 01:27,878
Things that move don't move along a straight line.

11
01:28,248 --> 01:31,438
And don't continue to move. And the reason is there's gravity.

12
01:31,698 --> 01:36,818
And there is another reason, even if you remove gravity, then there is friction.

13
01:37,258 --> 01:38,068
There's air drag.

14
01:38,558 --> 01:40,508
And so things will always come to a halt.

15
01:40,938 --> 01:53,928
But we believe though that in the absence of any forces, indeed an object, if it had a certain velocity, would continue along a straight line forever and ever and ever.

16
01:55,458 --> 02:01,918
Now this law, this very fundamental law does not hold in all reference frames.

17
02:02,418 --> 02:07,858
For instance, it doesn't hold in a reference frame which itself is being accelerated.

18
02:08,848 --> 02:12,368
Imagine that I accelerate myself right here.

19
02:13,088 --> 02:21,478
I either jump on my horse, or I take my bicycle, or my motorcycle or my car, and you see me being accelerated in this direction.

20
02:22,198 --> 02:23,398
And you sit there.

21
02:23,818 --> 02:27,468
And you say, aha, his velocity is changing.

22
02:27,758 --> 02:31,828
Therefore, according to the first law, there must be a force on on him.

23
02:32,088 --> 02:34,788
And you say, hey there, do you feel that force?

24
02:34,968 --> 02:38,698
And I said, yeah, I do. I really feel that I feel someone's pushing me.

25
02:38,998 --> 02:40,738
Consistent with the first law.

26
02:41,048 --> 02:42,988
Perfect. The first law works for you.

27
02:43,538 --> 02:44,538
Now I'm here.

28
02:44,918 --> 02:46,848
I'm being accelerated in this direction.

29
02:47,238 --> 02:51,968
And you all come towards me being accelerated in this direction, I say, aha, the first law should work.

30
02:53,528 --> 02:56,808
So, these people should feel a push.

31
02:57,068 --> 02:59,278
I say, hey there, do you feel the push?

32
02:59,278 --> 03:02,688
And you say, I feel nothing. There is no push, there is no pull.

33
03:02,688 --> 03:08,888
Therefore, the first law doesn't work from my frame of reference if I'm being accelerated towards you.

34
03:09,918 --> 03:15,318
So, now comes the question, when does the first law work?

35
03:15,318 --> 03:22,598
Well, the first law works when the frame of reference is what we call an inertial frame of reference.

36
03:22,948 --> 03:28,948
And an inertial frame of reference would then be a frame in which there are no accelerations of any kind.

37
03:30,378 --> 03:31,398
Is that possible?

38
03:31,578 --> 03:35,988
Is 26 100, is this lecture hall an inertial reference frame?

39
03:36,778 --> 03:42,638
For one, the Earth rotates about its own axis and 26 100 goes with it.

40
03:42,638 --> 03:44,238
That gives you a centripetal acceleration.

41
03:44,708 --> 03:47,578
Number two, the Earth goes around the sun.

42
03:48,378 --> 03:53,818
That gives it an centripetal acceleration, including the Earth, including you, including 26 100.

43
03:54,348 --> 03:58,098
The sun goes around the Milky Way and you can go on and on.

44
03:58,098 --> 04:04,768
So clearly, 26 100 is not an inertial reference frame.

45
04:06,228 --> 04:16,138
We can try to make an estimate on how large these accelerations are that we experience here in 26 100.

46
04:16,398 --> 04:19,868
And let's start with the one that is due to the Earth rotation.

47
04:20,308 --> 04:21,538
So here's the Earth.

48
04:23,628 --> 04:26,078
rotating with angular velocity omega.

49
04:26,888 --> 04:32,508
And here is the equator and the Earth has a certain radius.

50
04:34,018 --> 04:36,138
Radius of the Earth.

51
04:36,138 --> 04:37,548
This is the symbol for Earth.

52
04:38,098 --> 04:43,528
Now I know that 26 100 is here, but let's just take the worst case that you're on the equator.

53
04:44,028 --> 04:45,108
You're die.

54
04:46,088 --> 04:55,448
If you go around like this, and in order to do that, you need a centripetal acceleration, AC, which, as we have seen last time, equals omega square R.

55
04:56,618 --> 04:57,878
How large is that one?

56
04:58,288 --> 05:07,418
Well, the period of rotation for the Earth is 24 hours times 3600 seconds.

57
05:08,268 --> 05:18,688
So omega equals 2 pi divided by 24 times 3600 and that would then be in radians per second.

58
05:19,448 --> 05:29,548
And so you can calculate now what omega square R Earth is, if you know that the radius of the Earth is about 6, 400 kilometers.

59
05:30,158 --> 05:33,778
Make sure you convert this to meters, of course.

60
05:34,498 --> 05:45,648
And you will find then that the centripetal acceleration at the equator, which is the worst case, it's less here is 0.034 meters per second squared.

61
05:46,158 --> 05:47,918
And this is way, way less.

62
05:48,528 --> 05:55,578
This is 300 times smaller than the gravitational acceleration that you experience here on Earth.

63
05:56,018 --> 06:02,058
And if we take the motion of the earth around the sun, then it is an additional factor of five times lower.

64
06:02,618 --> 06:15,648
In other words, these accelerations, even though they're real and they can be measured easily with today's high-tech instrumentation, they are much, much lower than what we are used to, which is the gravitational acceleration.

65
06:15,648 --> 06:28,788
And therefore, in spite of these accelerations, we will accept this hole as a reasonably good inertial frame of reference in which the first law then should hold.

66
06:30,268 --> 06:32,658
Can Newton's law be proven?

67
06:33,258 --> 06:42,428
The answer is no, because it's impossible to be sure that your reference frame is without any accelerations.

68
06:42,738 --> 06:44,608
Do we believe in this? Yes, we do.

69
06:45,278 --> 06:53,508
We believe in it since it is consistent within the uncertainty of the measurements with all experiments that have been done.

70
06:55,008 --> 07:00,918
Now we come to the second law. Newton's second law.

71
07:02,768 --> 07:04,268
I have a spring.

72
07:06,328 --> 07:11,658
Forget gravity for now, you can do this somewhere in outer space.

73
07:11,658 --> 07:16,768
This is the relaxed length of the spring and I extend the spring.

74
07:17,588 --> 07:22,748
I extend it over a certain amount, certain distance. important how much.

75
07:22,998 --> 07:28,988
And I know that when I do that, that there will be a pool non-negotiable.

76
07:30,588 --> 07:40,988
I put a mass M1 here and I measure the acceleration that this pool causes on this mass immediately after I release. I can measure that.

77
07:41,588 --> 07:43,928
So I measure an acceleration A1.

78
07:44,888 --> 07:58,098
Now I replace this object by mass M2, but the extension is the same. So the pool must be the same. The spring doesn't know what the mass is at the other end, right?

79
07:58,098 --> 08:03,758
So the pool is the same. I put M2 there, different mass and I measure new acceleration A2.

80
08:04,478 --> 08:13,308
It is now an experimental fact that M1 A1 equals M2 A2.

81
08:14,798 --> 08:22,448
And this product MA, we call the force. That is our definition of force.

82
08:23,718 --> 08:31,428
So the same pool on a 10 times larger mass would give a 10 times lower acceleration.

83
08:33,698 --> 08:36,028
The second law, I will read to you.

84
08:37,498 --> 08:48,348
A force action on a body gives it an acceleration which is in the direction of the force, that's also important. Acceleration is in the direction of the force.

85
08:49,148 --> 08:51,338
And has a magnitude given by MA.

86
08:52,168 --> 08:56,928
MA is the magnitude and the direction is the direction of the force.

87
08:57,268 --> 09:16,488
And so now we will write this in all glorious detail, this is the second law by Newton, perhaps the most important law in all of physics, but certainly in all of 801.

88
09:17,098 --> 09:19,208
F equals MA.

89
09:20,138 --> 09:32,788
The units of this force are kilograms times meters per second squared in honor of the great man, we call that one Newton.

90
09:35,408 --> 09:40,798
Like the first law, the second law only holds in inertial reference frames.

91
09:42,338 --> 09:45,288
Can the first law, the second law be proven?

92
09:46,048 --> 09:46,568
No.

93
09:47,408 --> 09:49,068
Do we believe in it? Yes.

94
09:49,668 --> 09:50,938
Why do we believe in it?

95
09:51,538 --> 10:01,548
Because all experiments and all measurements within the uncertainty of the measurements are in agreement with the second law.

96
10:03,668 --> 10:09,478
Now you may object and you may say, this is strange what you've been doing.

97
10:09,938 --> 10:14,598
How can you ever determine a mass if there is no force somewhere?

98
10:14,968 --> 10:22,518
Because if you want to determine the mass, maybe you put it on a scale. And when you put it on a scale to determine the mass, you make use of the gravitational force.

99
10:22,518 --> 10:25,338
So, isn't that some kind of a circuital argument that you're using?

10:00:25,338 --> 10:00:27,508
And the answer is no.

10:00:28,518 --> 10:00:31,998
I can be somewhere in outer space where there is no gravity.

10:00:32,448 --> 10:00:34,678
I have two pieces of cheese.

10:00:34,678 --> 10:00:36,408
They are identical in size.

10:00:36,408 --> 10:00:37,868
This is cheese without holes by the way.

10:00:38,178 --> 10:00:40,198
They are identical in size.

10:00:41,038 --> 10:00:43,948
The sum of the two has double the mass of one.

10:00:44,568 --> 10:00:47,848
Mass is determined by how many molecules, how many atoms I have.

10:00:47,998 --> 10:00:50,878
I don't need gravity to have a relative scale of masses.

10:00:51,088 --> 10:00:55,878
So I can determine the relative scale of these masses without ever using a force.

10:00:56,488 --> 10:01:04,778
So, this is a very legitimate way of checking up on the second law.

11:04:778 --> 11:04:838
law.

11:06,558 --> 11:18,648
Since all objects in this lecture hall and near Earth fall with the constant acceleration which is G,

11:19,398 --> 11:28,098
we can write down that the gravitational force would be M times this acceleration G.

11:28,098 --> 11:34,888
I would normally write an A for it, but I make an exception now because of gravity, I call it gravitational force.

11:34,888 --> 11:44,038
And so you see that the gravitational force due to the earth on a particular mass is linearly proportional with the mass.

11:44,458 --> 11:51,498
If the mass becomes 10 times larger, then the force due to gravity goes up by a factor of 10.

11:53,818 --> 11:57,858
Suppose I have here this softball in my hand.

11:58,808 --> 12:04,808
In the reference frame of 26 100, we we will accept to be an inertial reference frame.

12:05,718 --> 12:08,148
It's not being accelerated in our reference frame.

12:08,768 --> 12:12,508
That means the force on it must be zero.

12:13,318 --> 12:16,078
So here is that ball.

12:16,948 --> 12:27,718
And we know if it has mass M, which in this case is about half a kilogram, that there must be a force here, mg, which is about 5 Newton.

12:28,348 --> 12:29,818
For half a kilogram.

12:30,218 --> 12:32,678
But the net force is zero.

12:33,438 --> 12:48,098
Therefore, it is very clear that I, Walter Lewin must push up with a force from my hand onto the ball, which is about of course the same, which is exactly the same 5 Newtons.

12:48,098 --> 12:51,928
Only now is there no acceleration.

12:52,388 --> 13:02,308
So I can write down that the force of water ruin plus the force of gravity equals zero.

13:02,978 --> 13:10,638
Because it's a one-dimensional problem, you could say that the force of Walter Lewin equals minus mg.

13:14,878 --> 13:16,518
F equals MA.

13:17,068 --> 13:23,408
Notice that there is no statement made on velocity or speed.

13:23,928 --> 13:28,988
As long as you know F, and as long as you know M, A is uniquely specified.

13:29,228 --> 13:31,958
No information is needed on the speed.

13:32,838 --> 13:40,798
So that would mean if we take gravity and an object was falling down with 5 meters per second, that the law would hold.

13:41,618 --> 13:46,548
If it would fall down with 5,000 meters per second,

13:47,118 --> 13:48,478
it would also hold.

13:48,978 --> 13:50,668
Will it always hold?

13:51,298 --> 13:52,018
No.

13:53,118 --> 14:02,908
Once your speed approaches the speed of light, then Newtonian mechanics no longer works, then you have to use Einstein's theory of special relativity.

14:03,638 --> 14:11,818
So this is only valid as long as we have speeds that are substantially smaller, say than the speed of light.

14:13,738 --> 14:17,548
Now we come to Newton's third law.

14:19,198 --> 14:29,348
If one object exerts a force on another, the other exerts the same force in opposite direction on the one.

14:30,868 --> 14:31,908
I read it again.

14:31,908 --> 14:42,168
If one object exerts a force on another, the other exerts the same force in opposite direction on the one.

14:42,988 --> 14:59,818
And I normally summarize that as follows, the third law as action equals minus reaction.

15:00,788 --> 15:04,558
And the minus sign indicates then that it opposes.

15:04,558 --> 15:05,968
So you sit on your seats,

15:06,838 --> 15:09,128
and you pull down on your seats,

15:09,868 --> 15:11,208
because of gravity.

15:12,328 --> 15:16,468
And the seats will push back on you with the same force.

15:16,978 --> 15:18,898
Action equals minus reaction.

15:19,488 --> 15:21,218
I held the baseball in my hand.

15:22,978 --> 15:25,738
The baseball pushes on my hand with a certain force.

15:26,068 --> 15:28,938
I push on the baseball with the same force.

15:30,288 --> 15:33,538
I push against the wall with a certain force.

15:33,918 --> 15:38,098
The wall pushes back in the opposite direction with exactly the same force.

15:38,658 --> 15:45,828
The third law always holds whether the objects are moving or accelerated makes no difference.

15:46,488 --> 15:59,708
At all moments in time, the force, we call it actually the contact force between two objects, one on the other is always the same as the other on one, but in the opposite direction.

16:01,758 --> 16:06,308
Let us work out a very simple example.

16:07,208 --> 16:12,988
We have an object which has a mass M1.

16:13,708 --> 16:15,038
This is object number one.

16:15,708 --> 16:18,658
And M1 is 5 kg.

16:18,978 --> 16:27,578
And here, attached to it is an object two, and M2 equals 15 kg.

16:28,718 --> 16:30,178
There is a force.

16:30,908 --> 16:34,028
And the force is coming in from this direction.

16:34,488 --> 16:35,498
This is the force.

16:36,108 --> 16:39,248
And the magnitude of the force is 20 Newtons.

16:40,218 --> 16:42,958
What is the acceleration of this system?

16:43,908 --> 16:44,968
F equals MA.

16:47,698 --> 16:52,358
Clearly, the mass is the sum of the two, this force acts on both.

16:52,868 --> 16:57,568
So we get M1 plus M2 times A.

16:58,528 --> 16:59,588
This is 20.

17:00,828 --> 17:01,618
This is 20.

17:02,508 --> 17:08,248
So A equals 1 ms per second squared in the same direction as F.

17:09,118 --> 17:12,508
So the whole system is being accelerated with 1 ms per second squared.

17:13,618 --> 17:15,228
Now watch me closely.

17:15,748 --> 17:22,858
Now I single out this object. Here it is.

17:23,648 --> 17:24,548
Object number two.

17:25,698 --> 17:34,108
Object number one, while this acceleration takes place, must be pushing on object number two, otherwise object number two could never be accelerated.

17:35,028 --> 17:42,448
I call that force F12, the force that one exerts on two.

17:44,078 --> 17:48,588
I know that number two has an acceleration of one, that's a given already.

17:50,878 --> 17:53,558
So here comes F equals MA.

17:53,918 --> 17:58,178
F12 equals M2 times A.

17:58,738 --> 18:00,968
We know A is 1.

18:01,688 --> 18:03,548
We know M2 is 15.

18:04,118 --> 18:10,958
So we see that the magnitude of the force 12 is 15 Newtons.

18:12,348 --> 18:14,768
This force is 15.

18:16,808 --> 18:20,798
Now I'm going to isolate number one out.

18:22,668 --> 18:24,028
Here is number one.

18:27,388 --> 18:33,588
Number one experiences this force F, which was the 20.

18:34,608 --> 18:38,608
And it must experience a contact force from number two.

18:40,708 --> 18:46,548
Somehow, number two must be pushing on number one, if one is pushing on number two.

18:47,008 --> 18:50,768
And I call that force F 21.

18:52,618 --> 18:55,818
I know that number one is being accelerated.

18:56,058 --> 18:58,968
And I know the magnitude, it's 1 meter per second square.

18:58,968 --> 18:59,938
That's non-negotiable.

19:01,278 --> 19:11,838
And so we have that F this one plus F 21 must be M1 times A.

19:12,928 --> 19:13,668
This is one.

19:14,398 --> 19:15,658
This is five.

19:16,318 --> 19:17,228
This is 20.

19:17,748 --> 19:22,348
And so this one, you can already see is minus 15.

19:22,848 --> 19:30,678
F21 is in this direction and the magnitude is exactly the same as F12.

19:31,388 --> 19:43,398
So you see, one is pushing on two with 15 Newtons in this direction, two is pushing back on one with 15 Newtons and the whole system is being accelerated with 1 meter per second squared.

19:47,728 --> 20:06,638
Now in these two examples, the one whereby I had the baseball on my hand, you saw that it was consistent with the third law. In this example, you also see that it's consistent with the third law. The contact force from one on the other is the same as from the other on one but in opposite signs.

20:06,908 --> 20:09,038
Is this a proof? No.

20:09,808 --> 20:12,728
Can the third law be proven? No.

20:13,468 --> 20:15,408
Do we believe in it? Yes.

20:16,078 --> 20:17,488
Why do we believe in it?

20:17,778 --> 20:26,398
Because all measurements, all experiments within the uncertainties are consistent with the third law.

20:29,738 --> 20:34,508
Action equals minus reaction. It is something that you experience every day.

20:36,528 --> 20:47,558
I remember I had a garden hose in the lawn and I would open the faucet and the garden hose would start to snake backwards. Why?

20:48,438 --> 20:49,968
Water squirts out.

20:50,538 --> 20:52,928
The garden hose pushes onto the water in this direction.

20:53,238 --> 20:56,888
The water pushes back onto the garden hose and it snakes back.

20:57,158 --> 20:59,948
Action equals minus reaction.

21:00,868 --> 21:01,898
You take a balloon.

21:04,258 --> 21:08,128
You take a balloon and you blow up the balloon.

21:08,488 --> 21:09,638
And you let the air out.

21:09,948 --> 21:14,178
The balloon pushes onto the air, the air must push onto the balloon.

21:14,678 --> 21:21,038
And therefore, when you let it go, the balloon will go in this direction, which is the basic idea behind the rocket.

21:23,978 --> 21:24,208
shh

21:26,398 --> 21:30,488
I love to play with balloons, don't you?

21:31,158 --> 21:36,138
So, if I do it like this and I let it go, the air will come out in this direction.

21:36,598 --> 21:41,888
And so then that means the balloon is pushing on the air in this direction, the air must be pushing on the balloon in this direction.

21:42,198 --> 21:43,038
There it goes.

21:43,918 --> 21:48,998
Didn't make it to the moon, but you saw the the idea of a rocket.

21:49,968 --> 21:53,618
Action equals minus reaction.

21:56,238 --> 21:58,018
If you fire a gun,

21:58,508 --> 22:02,748
the gun exerts a force on the bullet.

22:02,998 --> 22:06,538
The bullet exerts an equal force on the gun, which is called the recoil.

22:06,948 --> 22:07,768
You feel that.

22:08,438 --> 22:10,378
In your hands, in your shoulder.

22:12,538 --> 22:19,908
I have here a marvelous device which is a beautiful example of action equals minus reaction.

22:19,908 --> 22:25,118
I show you from above what it looks like, you'll see more details later.

22:25,848 --> 22:27,918
This rotates about this axis.

22:28,668 --> 22:30,958
rather freely, the axis is vertical.

22:31,258 --> 22:39,138
And we have here a reservoir of water which we will heat up, turns into steam, and these are hollow tubes and the steam will square it out.

22:39,698 --> 22:44,728
And so when the steam square out in this direction,

22:45,478 --> 22:49,968
the tube exerts a force on the steam in this direction.

22:50,598 --> 22:57,738
So the steam exerts an equal force but opposite direction and so the thing will start to rotate like this.

22:58,608 --> 23:01,928
And I would like to demonstrate that.

23:12,358 --> 23:15,908
You can see it now there, with a little bit of luck, there you see it.

23:17,388 --> 23:19,558
So, we're going to heat it.

23:24,378 --> 23:25,478
Walking.

23:26,488 --> 23:29,888
When you walk, you push against the floor.

23:30,508 --> 23:32,428
The floor pushes back at you.

23:32,988 --> 23:38,008
And if the floor wouldn't push back at you, you couldn't even walk, you couldn't go forward.

23:40,698 --> 23:44,928
If you walk on ice, very slippery, you can't go anywhere.

23:45,878 --> 23:48,938
Because you can't push on the ice, so the ice won't push back on you.

23:50,678 --> 23:54,088
That's another example where you see action equals minus reaction.

23:56,418 --> 23:58,828
This engine is called Hero's engine.

23:59,678 --> 24:07,798
Hero, according to the Greek legend, was a priestess of Aphrodite.

24:08,668 --> 24:09,878
Let's first look at it.

24:19,728 --> 24:22,728
She was a priestess of Aphrodite.

24:24,118 --> 24:30,808
And her lover Leander would swim across the Hellespont every night to be with her.

24:30,808 --> 24:37,728
And then one night, the poor guy drowned and Hero threw herself into the sea.

24:38,548 --> 24:43,348
Very romantic thing to do, but of course, also not very smart thing to do.

24:44,168 --> 24:50,728
On the other hand, it must have been a smart lady if she invented really this engine.

24:51,678 --> 24:57,548
Yesterday, I looked at the web ask.com.

24:57,998 --> 24:58,808
It's wonderful.

24:58,808 --> 25:03,978
You can ask any question. You can say, how old am I? Now, you may not get the right answer, but you can ask any question.

25:04,868 --> 25:07,588
And I typed in Hero's engine.

25:08,058 --> 25:15,238
And out popped a very nice high-tech version of Hero's engine.

25:16,678 --> 25:18,098
A soda can.

25:18,668 --> 25:22,588
You pop four holes in the soda can at the bottom.

25:22,868 --> 25:24,788
So here's your soda can.

25:25,658 --> 25:27,008
You pop four holes in here.

25:27,008 --> 25:32,508
But when you put the nail in there, you bend every time the nail to the same side, so the holes are slanted.

25:33,688 --> 25:39,058
You put in water, you lift it out of water and you have an Hero's engine.

25:39,428 --> 25:41,728
And I made it for you. It took me only five minutes.

25:42,378 --> 25:47,588
I went to one of MIT's machines, got myself soda.

25:48,698 --> 25:50,348
Put the holes in it.

25:50,848 --> 25:51,758
And here it is.

25:51,998 --> 25:52,948
It's in the water there.

25:53,778 --> 25:56,998
When I lift it out, you'll see the water squirt. There it goes.

25:58,778 --> 26:01,538
High-tech version of Hero's Engine.

26:04,998 --> 26:07,828
It also makes a bit of a mess, but okay.

26:08,818 --> 26:09,658
All right.

26:14,218 --> 26:18,598
Try to make one, it's fun. And it's very quick. It doesn't take much time at all.

26:27,268 --> 26:32,738
There are some bizarre consequences of these laws.

26:33,838 --> 26:37,108
Imagine that an object is falling towards the earth.

26:37,878 --> 26:38,958
An apple.

26:39,628 --> 26:46,158
It's falling towards the earth from a height say of um let's say 100 m.

26:47,728 --> 26:54,298
Now let's calculate how long it takes for this apple to hit the earth, which should for you be trivial, of course.

26:55,508 --> 26:56,828
So here's the earth.

26:59,768 --> 27:07,888
The mass of the earth is about 6 * 10 to the 24 kg.

27:09,668 --> 27:19,358
And here at a distance H for which we will take 100 m, is this apple M which say has a mass of half a kilogram.

27:20,908 --> 27:25,358
There is a force from the earth onto the apple.

27:25,858 --> 27:37,618
And this is that force, and the magnitude of that force is mg and that is 5 Newton. I take g 10 just round it off a little.

27:39,668 --> 27:46,358
Now, how long does it take this object to hit the earth?

27:47,188 --> 27:58,008
So we know that 12 GT squared equals h.

27:58,128 --> 27:58,968
doesn't start with any initial speed.

27:59:0 --> 27:59,478
So that is 100.

27:59:478 --> 28:02,158
G is 10, this is 5, so T squared is 20.

28:03,408 --> 28:07,178
So T is about 4 and 1/2 seconds.

28:08,138 --> 28:11,288
So after 4 and 1/2 seconds, it hits the earth. So far so good.

28:11,978 --> 28:21,888
But now, according to the third law, the Earth must experience exactly the same force as the apple does, but in opposite direction.

28:22,748 --> 28:32,608
So therefore, the Earth will experience this same force F 5 Newton in this direction.

28:33,418 --> 28:35,438
What is the earth going to do?

28:35,758 --> 28:39,048
Well, the earth is going to fall towards the apple.

28:39,448 --> 28:41,048
F equals MA.

28:41,928 --> 28:49,528
So the force on the earth is the mass of the earth times the acceleration of the earth.

28:50,328 --> 28:52,358
The force we know is five.

28:52,688 --> 28:54,998
We know the mass, 6 * 10 to the 24.

28:55,678 --> 29:08,988
So the acceleration will be 5 divided by 6 * 10 to the 24 which is about 8 * 10 to the minus 25 meters per second squared.

29:11,688 --> 29:14,118
How long will the earth fall?

29:14,298 --> 29:18,868
Well, the earth will fall roughly 4 and 1/2 seconds before they collide.

29:19,838 --> 29:23,968
How far does the earth move in the 4 and 1/2 seconds?

29:24,318 --> 29:31,828
Well, it moves 1 half A Earth T squared.

29:32,228 --> 29:33,968
It's a distance that it moves.

29:33,968 --> 29:39,048
We know A and we know T squared, which is 20.

29:39,048 --> 29:46,488
1/2 * 20 is 10. So that means this distance becomes that number times 10 is about 8 * 10 to the minus 24 m.

29:47,288 --> 29:51,908
The Earth moves 8 * 10 to the minus 24 m.

29:52,658 --> 29:55,968
That, of course, is impossible to measure.

29:56,888 --> 29:58,198
But just imagine.

29:58,828 --> 30:01,488
What a wonderful concept this is.

30:03,808 --> 30:14,388
When this ball falls back to me, the earth and you and I and MIT

30:14,888 --> 30:15,878
are falling towards the ball.

30:16,308 --> 30:19,588
Every time that the ball comes down, we're falling towards the ball.

30:19,588 --> 30:23,118
Imagine the power I have over you and over the earth.

30:24,388 --> 30:27,058
But, you may want to think about this.

30:27,478 --> 30:35,588
If I throw the ball up, going to be away from the earth, I bet you anything that the earth will also go away from the ball.

30:36,168 --> 30:42,528
So as I do this, casually playing, believe me, man, what a gorgeous feeling it is.

30:43,068 --> 30:45,808
Earth is going down, Earth is coming towards the ball.

30:45,988 --> 30:47,748
The earth is going down and I'm part of the earth.

30:47,978 --> 30:53,608
And I'm shaking this earth up and down by simply playing with this ball.

30:54,148 --> 31:04,138
That is the consequence of Newton's third law, even though the amount by which the earth moves is of course too small to be measured.

31:06,628 --> 31:19,308
I now want to work out with you a rather detailed example of something in which we combine what we have learned today.

31:19,988 --> 31:27,808
A down-to-earth problem, the kind of a problem that you might see on an exam or on an assignment.

31:28,648 --> 31:34,168
We hang an object on two strings.

31:36,668 --> 31:42,788
And one string makes an angle of 60 degrees

31:44,638 --> 31:49,258
with the vertical and the other makes an angle of 45 degrees with the vertical.

31:49,538 --> 31:50,528
So this is the one

31:53,238 --> 31:59,658
that makes an angle Oh, 60 degrees with the horizon, 30 degrees with the vertical.

31:59,908 --> 32:02,478
And this one, 45 degrees.

32:04,998 --> 32:07,428
Let's assume that the strings have negligible mass.

32:08,668 --> 32:10,728
So they're attached here to the ceiling.

32:12,568 --> 32:15,208
And I hang here an object M.

32:16,248 --> 32:17,088
Well,

32:17,728 --> 32:24,078
If there's an object M, for sure, there will be a force

32:24,798 --> 32:26,718
mg gravitational force.

32:28,148 --> 32:31,498
This object is hanging there, it's not being accelerated.

32:31,768 --> 32:34,488
So the net acceleration must be zero.

32:35,238 --> 32:42,338
And so one string must be pulling in this direction and the other string must be pulling in this direction so that the net force on the system is zero.

32:44,158 --> 32:49,728
Let's call this pool for now T1. We call that the tension in this string.

32:51,118 --> 32:56,178
And we call the tension in this string T2.

32:57,928 --> 33:02,658
And the question now is how large is T1 and how large is T2.

33:03,788 --> 33:06,178
There are various ways you can do this.

33:06,718 --> 33:09,258
One way that's always works pretty safe.

33:10,418 --> 33:12,968
You call this the X direction.

33:13,238 --> 33:16,618
You may choose which direction you call plus, I call this plus.

33:17,768 --> 33:19,448
I call this negative.

33:19,928 --> 33:25,818
And you could call this the Y direction and you may call this plus and this negative.

33:27,338 --> 33:39,938
I know from Newton's second law F equals MA that there is no acceleration, so this must be zero.

33:40,558 --> 33:45,048
So the sum of all forces on that mass must be zero.

33:46,488 --> 33:49,488
These three forces must eat each other up so to speak.

33:50,758 --> 33:58,598
Well, if that's the case, then the sum of all forces in the X direction must also be zero because there's no acceleration in the X direction.

33:58,598 --> 34:02,758
And the sum of all forces in the Y direction must be zero.

34:02,758 --> 34:12,508
And so I'm going to decompose them, something we have done before, I'm going to decompose the forces into an X and into a Y direction.

34:14,338 --> 34:15,048
So,

34:15,898 --> 34:28,098
here comes the X component of T1 and its magnitude is T1 times the cosine of 60 degrees.

34:29,918 --> 34:30,398
Yeah.

34:34,748 --> 34:37,768
Now, I want to know what this one is.

34:43,458 --> 34:51,988
This one is T1 times the sign of 60 degrees.

34:55,298 --> 34:57,878
This projection

34:59,388 --> 35:04,928
T2 cosine 45 degrees.

35:06,068 --> 35:13,558
And the Y component T2 times the sign of 45 degrees.

35:14,908 --> 35:17,368
So, we go into the X direction.

35:18,948 --> 35:33,988
In the X direction, I have T1 cosine 60 degrees minus T2 cosine 45 degrees equals 0. That's one equation.

35:36,538 --> 35:46,488
The cosine of 60 degrees is 1/2 and the cosine of 45 degrees is 1/2 square root 2.

35:48,188 --> 35:49,918
Now I go to the Y direction.

35:51,008 --> 35:53,478
This is plus, this is minus.

35:54,238 --> 36:07,708
So we get one component here which is T1 times the sign of 60 degrees plus T2 times the sign of 45 degrees.

36:08,398 --> 36:12,348
minus mg is in the opposite direction must be zero.

36:13,218 --> 36:14,618
That's my second equation.

36:15,108 --> 36:26,018
The sign of 60 degrees equals 1/2 square root 3

36:26,598 --> 36:30,908
and the sign of 45 degrees is the same as the cosine 1/2 square root 2.

36:31,708 --> 36:36,808
Notice, I have two equations with two unknowns. If you tell me what M is, I should be able to solve for T1 and for T2.

36:41,338 --> 37:07,248
In fact, if we add them up, it's going to be very easy because we lose this, because we have both 1/2 square root 2. And so you see immediately here that 1/2 * T1 + 1/2 square root 3 * T1 = mg

37:07,668 --> 37:16,108
And so you find that the tension one equals 2 mg divided by 1 plus the square root of 3.

37:16,758 --> 37:18,798
I can go back now to this equation.

37:19,788 --> 37:30,218
T1 * 1/2 equals T2 * 1/2 square√ of 2.

37:30,748 --> 37:36,908
I lose my half, and so T2 equals T1 divided by the square√ of 2.

37:37,558 --> 37:42,588
So the bottom line is, you tell me what M is, I tell you what T1 is and I'll tell you what T2 is.

37:43,888 --> 37:56,418
Suppose we take a mass of 4 kg. mg is about 40 if we make g10 for simplicity.

37:57,008 --> 38:03,198
Then T1, if you put in the numbers, is about 29.3.

38:03,768 --> 38:13,308
And T2 29.3 Newtons and T2 is about 20.7 Newtons, I believe.

38:16,348 --> 38:22,248
It's very difficult to rig this up as an experiment, but I've I've tried that.

38:22,538 --> 38:23,788
I'll show you in a minute.

38:25,948 --> 38:39,988
I want you to know that there is another method which is perhaps even more elegant and which you may consider in which there is no decomposition in the two directions.

38:43,048 --> 38:44,418
Here is MG.

38:46,058 --> 38:47,568
That's a given.

38:48,628 --> 38:53,198
And we know that the other directions are also given.

38:53,198 --> 38:57,888
This angle is 30 degrees here, and this angle 45 degrees.

38:58,818 --> 39:01,978
If these two forces must cancel out this one,

39:02,388 --> 39:04,658
why don't I flip this one over?

39:05,088 --> 39:06,168
Here it comes.

39:08,508 --> 39:10,018
I flip it over.

39:11,278 --> 39:12,278
There it is.

39:13,028 --> 39:17,858
T1 and T2 now together must add up to this one.

39:18,208 --> 39:19,228
Then the problem is solved.

39:19,388 --> 39:20,968
Then the net force is zero.

39:21,278 --> 39:22,228
Well, that's easy.

39:22,438 --> 39:23,408
I do this.

39:28,708 --> 39:38,038
And now I have constructed a complete fair construction of T1 and of T2.

39:39,158 --> 39:40,878
It's no physics anymore, now it's all over.

39:41,368 --> 39:43,408
You know this angle here, 45 degrees.

39:43,618 --> 39:44,698
So this is 45 degrees.

39:44,848 --> 39:46,168
This is 30, this is 30.

39:46,168 --> 39:57,588
You know all the angles and you know this magnitude is MD, so it's a high school problem. You have a triangle with all the angles and one side, you can calculate the other sides and you should find exactly the same answer, of course.

39:58,888 --> 40:02,688
We made an attempt to rig it up.

40:03,088 --> 40:09,018
How do we measure tension? Well, we put in these lines scales, tension meters.

40:09,018 --> 40:11,938
And that is problematic, believe me.

40:12,398 --> 40:18,678
We put in here a tension meter, we put in here a tension meter, and the bottom one, we hang

40:19,908 --> 40:26,118
on a string with a tension meter and then here we put 4 kg.

40:27,078 --> 40:29,848
These scales are not massless.

40:30,508 --> 40:31,918
That's already problematic.

40:31,918 --> 40:33,868
The scales are not very accurate.

40:34,528 --> 40:38,078
So, we may not even come close to these numbers.

40:38,608 --> 40:46,278
For sure, if I put 4 kg here, then I would like this one to read 40 Newtons or somewhere in that neighborhood.

40:46,578 --> 40:50,008
Depending upon how accurate my my meters are.

40:50,008 --> 40:51,608
These are springs.

40:52,228 --> 40:57,688
And the springs extend, and when the springs extend, you see a handle, a hand go.

40:58,688 --> 41:09,978
You can clearly see how that works, because if there is a force on that bottom scale in this direction, which is mg,

41:10,498 --> 41:15,298
and it's not being accelerated, then the string must pull upwards.

41:15,858 --> 41:18,458
And so, in order to make the net force zero.

41:18,458 --> 41:26,708
And if you have a pull down here and you have a pull up here, and you have in here a spring, then you see you have a way of measuring that force.

41:26,948 --> 41:30,898
We often do that. We measure with springs the tension in strings.

41:31,768 --> 41:36,378
For whatever it's worse, I will show you what we rigged up.

41:36,378 --> 41:41,818
Now, a measurement without knowledge of uncertainties is meaningless. I told you that.

41:42,318 --> 41:46,768
So maybe this is meaningless what I'm going to do now. Let me do something meaningless for once.

41:47,418 --> 41:53,238
And remember, when I show it, you can always close your eyes so that you haven't seen it.

41:54,098 --> 41:58,548
So, we have here something that approaches this 60 degrees.

41:59,168 --> 42:01,348
And this approaches the 45 degrees.

42:02,238 --> 42:05,338
And we're going to hang 4 kg at the bottom.

42:09,298 --> 42:10,378
And there it is.

42:11,028 --> 42:12,408
And here it is.

42:13,008 --> 42:14,958
All right, this one's not too far from 40.

42:15,328 --> 42:16,808
It's not an embarrassment.

42:17,048 --> 42:19,818
This one is not too far from 20.7.

42:20,258 --> 42:22,858
This one is a bit on the low side. Maybe I can push it up a little.

42:23,288 --> 42:25,558
See it gets close to 30, it's not bad.

42:26,088 --> 42:31,298
So you see, it's very difficult to get these angles right, but it's not too far off.

42:32,378 --> 42:36,878
So let's remove this again because this will block your view.

42:37,448 --> 42:41,998
These scales were calibrated in Newtons as you could see.

42:45,858 --> 42:50,708
Now we come to something very delicate.

42:51,798 --> 42:56,858
Now I need your alertness and I need your help.

42:58,698 --> 43:04,898
I have a block, you see it there, and that block weighs 2 kg.

43:05,918 --> 43:07,428
That red block.

43:08,518 --> 43:09,598
So here it is.

43:10,898 --> 43:11,758
It's red.

43:13,088 --> 43:14,448
And I have two strings.

43:15,708 --> 43:19,848
It's hanging from a black string here and a black string there.

43:19,848 --> 43:22,098
Ignore that red string, that is just a safety.

43:22,678 --> 43:26,778
But there's a very thin thread here and here.

43:27,478 --> 43:31,848
And they are as close as we can make them the same. They come from the same batch.

43:33,668 --> 43:39,248
This one has a mass of 2 kg and this spring string has no mass.

43:39,798 --> 43:41,068
This is 2 kg.

43:43,138 --> 43:51,068
So what will be the tension in the upper string, which is string number one. This is string number two.

43:51,638 --> 43:56,358
Well, this string must be able to carry this 2 kg, so the tension has to be 20 Newtons.

43:57,068 --> 43:58,908
So you will find here tension

43:59:808 --> 44:02,978
call it T1 which is about 20 Newtons.

44:04,348 --> 44:05,488
Force equals MA.

44:06,908 --> 44:18,228
So, it's pulling up on this object. It's also pulling down from the ceiling by the way, think about it. It's pulling as pushing pulling from the ceiling.

44:18,608 --> 44:21,038
The tension is here, 20 Newtons.

44:21,368 --> 44:26,038
We could put in here one of these scales and you would see approximately 20 Newtons.

44:26,748 --> 44:31,758
What is the tension here? Well, the tension here is very close to zero.

44:32,218 --> 44:36,738
There's nothing hanging on it and the string has no weight, so there's no tension there. You can see that.

44:39,628 --> 44:44,828
Now I am going to pull on here.

44:45,748 --> 44:54,418
And I'm going to increase the tension on the bottom one until one of the two breaks.

44:55,918 --> 45:02,008
So this tension goes up and up.

45:02,348 --> 45:11,758
And therefore, since this object is not being accelerated, you're going to get a force down now on this object, this tension must increase, right?

45:12,898 --> 45:13,728
You see that.

45:14,278 --> 45:20,198
If I have a force on this one, so there is a force here.

45:21,028 --> 45:23,688
And there is mg.

45:23,978 --> 45:28,158
Then of course this string must now be mg plus this force.

45:28,468 --> 45:32,448
So the tension will go up here and the tension will go up here.

45:32,888 --> 45:36,738
The strings are as identical as they can be.

45:37,318 --> 45:39,838
Which of the strings will break first?

45:40,248 --> 45:41,398
What do you think?

45:42,228 --> 45:42,818
The bottom.

45:44,158 --> 45:44,978
Excuse me?

45:45,938 --> 45:48,918
I can't hear you. The one on top.

45:49,238 --> 45:51,728
Who is in favor of the one on top?

45:53,168 --> 45:56,818
Who says no, the bottom one?

45:58,598 --> 46:02,258
Who says they won't break at all?

46:03,278 --> 46:04,088
Okay.

46:04,898 --> 46:06,278
Let's take a look at it.

46:06,958 --> 46:08,828
The one on top.

46:10,618 --> 46:12,928
That's the most likely, right? 3, 2, 1, 0.

46:17,298 --> 46:18,938
The bottom one broke.

46:20,678 --> 46:22,138
My goodness.

46:22,688 --> 46:27,908
Newton's second law is at stake, Newton's third law is at stake, the whole world is at stake.

46:28,858 --> 46:30,788
Something is not working.

46:32,278 --> 46:36,928
I increased tension here. This one didn't break.

46:36,928 --> 46:38,518
Is this one stronger perhaps?

46:38,518 --> 46:40,798
No, I don't cheat on you. I'm not a magician.

46:40,988 --> 46:42,168
I want to teach you physics.

46:44,218 --> 46:46,548
Did we overlook something?

46:46,788 --> 46:48,858
You know, I'll give you a second chance.

46:48,858 --> 46:49,948
We'll do it again.

46:50,598 --> 46:51,958
Let's have another vote.

46:52,928 --> 46:55,418
So I'll give you a chance to change your mind.

46:55,418 --> 46:58,688
There's nothing wrong in life changing your mind. It's one of the greatest things that you can do.

47:01,958 --> 47:04,358
What do you think will happen now?

47:07,308 --> 47:10,988
Who is in favor still of the top one? Seeing is believing.

47:11,168 --> 47:12,248
You still insist on the top one.

47:12,248 --> 47:13,768
Who is now in favor of the bottom one?

47:14,278 --> 47:16,528
Ah, many of you got converted, right?

47:17,328 --> 47:18,018
Okay.

47:18,418 --> 47:20,428
There we go. 3, 2, 1, 0.

47:21,918 --> 47:25,008
The top one broke.

47:25,818 --> 47:27,458
So some of you were right.

47:27,848 --> 47:29,178
Now I'm getting so confused.

47:30,248 --> 47:31,958
I can't believe it anymore.

47:32,268 --> 47:36,008
First we argued that the top one should break, but it didn't. The bottom one broke.

47:36,988 --> 47:40,548
Then we had another vote, and then the top one broke.

47:40,938 --> 47:42,528
Is someone pulling our leg?

47:43,228 --> 47:45,078
I suggest we do it one more time.

47:46,208 --> 47:50,748
I suggest we do it one more time and whatever is going to happen, that's the winner.

47:51,388 --> 47:53,958
If the top one breaks, that's the winner.

47:54,748 --> 47:58,228
The bottom one breaks, well, then we have to accept that.

47:58,558 --> 48:01,138
But I want you to vote again.

48:01,988 --> 48:11,228
I want you to vote again on this decisive measurement whether the top one will break first or the bottom one.

48:12,418 --> 48:14,228
Who is in favor of the top one?

48:16,928 --> 48:20,118
Many of you are scared, right? You're not voting anymore.

48:20,888 --> 48:22,678
I can tell you're not voting.

48:22,938 --> 48:24,748
Who is in favor of the bottom one?

48:26,518 --> 48:28,648
Only 10 people are voting.

48:29:968 --> 48:33,618
Let's do this in an undemocratic way.

48:34,088 --> 48:35,878
You may decide. What's your name?

48:36:798 --> 48:37:488
Elisa?

48:38:328 --> 48:39:848
Georgia, close enough.

48:41,738 --> 48:46,178
You may decide whether the top one or the bottom one will break.

48:46,488 --> 48:49,788
Isn't that great? Doesn't give you a fantastic amount of power?

48:52,788 --> 48:54,028
The bottom one.

48:55,168 --> 48:56,268
The bottom one.

48:57,828 --> 48:58,718
We're ready?

48:59:448 --> 49:02,598
3, 2, 1, 0. one broke.

49:03,108 --> 49:03,958
You were right.

49:04,248 --> 49:05,588
You will pass this course.

49:06,068 --> 49:09,938
Thank you and see you Wednesday. By the way, think about this.

49:10:778 --> 49:11,818
Think about this.
