1
00:00:00,467 --> 00:03,767
The bad news today is that there will be
quite a bit of math.

2
00:04,297 --> 00:10,997
But the good news is that we will only do it once,
and it will only take something like half hour.

3
00:12,397 --> 00:17,427
There are quantities in physics
which are determined uniquely by one number.

4
00:18,037 --> 00:19,287
Mass is one of them.

5
00:19,647 --> 00:20,957
Temperature is one of them.

6
00:21,147 --> 00:22,287
Speed is one of them.

7
00:22,637 --> 00:23,917
We call those scalars.

8
00:24,387 --> 00:26,467
There are others where you need more than one number.

9
00:26,767 --> 00:35,307
For instance, on a one-dimensional motion,
velocity, it has a certain magnitude,
that's the speed, but you also have to know
whether it goes this way or that way.

10
00:35,777 --> 00:37,517
So there has to be a direction.

11
00:38,057 --> 00:42,667
Velocity is a vector, and acceleration
is a vector.

12
00:43,207 --> 00:48,427
And today we're going to learn how to work
with these vectors.

13
00:49,087 --> 00:58,067
A vector has a length and a vector
has a direction, and that's why we actually
represent it by an arrow.

14
00:58,697 --> 01:02,197
You all have seen this is a vector.

15
01:02,727 --> 01:04,897
Remember this, this is a vector.

16
01:05,317 --> 01:11,027
If you look at the vector head on, you see a dot.
If you look at the vector from behind, you see a cross.

17
01:11,437 --> 01:17,567
This is a vector and that will be our representation
of vectors.

18
01:18,657 --> 01:23,347
Imagine that I'm standing on a table in 26 100.

19
01:24,327 --> 01:26,187
This is the table.

20
01:27,787 --> 01:32,617
And I am standing, say at point O.

21
01:33,737 --> 01:41,407
And I move along a straight line
from O to point P.

22
01:42,297 --> 01:43,817
So I move like so.

23
01:44,517 --> 01:51,477
So that's where I am on the table and that's
where you will see me when you look from 26 100.

24
01:52,027 --> 02:00,627
It just so happens that someone is also going to move
the table in that same amount of time from here to there.

25
02:01,467 --> 02:12,027
So that means that the table will have moved down,
and so my point P will have moved down
exactly the same way.

26
02:12,637 --> 02:15,507
And so you will see me now at point S.

27
02:15,827 --> 02:22,277
You will see me at point S in 26 100, although
I'm still standing at the same location on the table.

28
02:22,527 --> 02:24,207
The table has moved.

29
02:24,687 --> 02:27,447
This is now the position of the table.

30
02:28,797 --> 02:32,037
See the whole table has shifted.

31
02:32,617 --> 02:45,417
Now, if these two motions take place simultaneously,
then what you will see from where you're sitting,
you will see me move in 26 100 from O straight line to S.

32
02:45,857 --> 02:52,057
And this holds the secret behind the adding
of vectors.

33
02:52,527 --> 03:04,327
We say here that the vector OS, we put an arrow over it,
is the vector OP with an arrow over it plus PS.

34
03:05,587 --> 03:10,337
This defines how we add vectors.

35
03:11,167 --> 03:14,167
There are various ways that you can add vectors.

36
03:14,717 --> 03:22,397
Suppose I have here a vector A,
and I have here a vector B.

37
03:23,257 --> 03:30,547
Then you can do it this way, which I call the
head tail technique. I take B and I bring it to the head of A.

38
03:32,907 --> 03:36,817
So this is B. This is a vector.

39
03:37,327 --> 03:40,367
And then the net result is A + B.

40
03:42,167 --> 03:48,617
This vector C equals A + B.

41
03:49,567 --> 03:59,357
That's one way of doing it. Doesn't matter whether you take B
the tail of B to the head of A or whether you take
the tail of A and bring it to the head of B, you will get the same result.

42
03:59,897 --> 04:04,397
There's another way you can do it,
and I call that the parallelogram method.

43
04:05,207 --> 04:06,917
Here you have A.

44
04:08,287 --> 04:11,257
You bring the two tails together.

45
04:12,707 --> 04:15,807
So here is B now. So the tails are touching.

46
04:16,297 --> 04:18,397
And now you complete this parallelogram.

47
04:22,517 --> 04:30,467
And now this vector C is the same sum vector
that you have here.

48
04:31,057 --> 04:32,437
Whichever way you prefer.

49
04:32,657 --> 04:36,307
You see immediately that A + B is the same as B + A.

50
04:36,727 --> 04:38,147
There is no difference.

51
04:41,777 --> 04:44,517
What is the meaning of a negative vector?

52
04:45,367 --> 04:48,177
Well, A - A equals zero.

53
04:48,917 --> 04:53,477
Vector A subtract vector A equals zero.

54
04:54,177 --> 04:55,557
So here is vector A.

55
04:57,787 --> 05:02,317
So which vector do I have to add to get zero?

56
05:03,087 --> 05:04,717
I have to add minus A.

57
05:05,177 --> 05:18,217
Well, if you use the head tail technique,
this is A, you have to add this vector
to have zero, so this is minus A. And so minus A is nothing
but the same as A but flipped over 180 degrees.

58
05:18,557 --> 05:20,547
We will use that very often.

59
05:22,047 --> 05:27,057
And that brings us to the point of
subtraction of vectors.

60
05:27,327 --> 05:29,327
How do we subtract vectors?

61
05:30,147 --> 05:36,567
So A minus B equals C.

62
05:37,837 --> 05:39,387
Here we have vector A.

63
05:43,037 --> 05:48,627
And here we have vector B.

64
05:52,577 --> 05:54,387
One way to look at this is the following.

65
05:54,737 --> 06:01,407
You can say A minus B is A plus minus B.

66
06:02,107 --> 06:09,077
And we know how to add vectors, and we know
what minus B is. Minus B is the same vector,
but flipped over.

67
06:09,687 --> 06:12,527
So we put here minus B.

68
06:15,417 --> 06:20,407
And so this vector now here equals A
minus B.

69
06:23,777 --> 06:27,557
This vector C is A minus B.

70
06:28,027 --> 06:38,067
And of course, you can do it in different ways.
You can also think of it as A plus
as C + B is A.

71
06:38,557 --> 06:43,777
Right? You can say, you can bring this to the other side,
you can say C + B is A.

72
06:44,397 --> 06:51,457
C + B is A. In other words, which
vector do I have to add to B to get A?

73
06:51,817 --> 06:58,887
And then you have the parallelogram technique again.
There are many ways you can do it. The head tail technique
is perhaps the easiest and the safest.

74
06:59,307 --> 07:12,347
So you can add countless number of vectors,
one plus the other, then next one,
and you finally have the sum of five or six or seven vectors,
which then can be represented by only one.

75
07:13,477 --> 07:19,057
When you add scalars, for instance five and four,
then there is only one answer that is nine.

76
07:19,667 --> 07:21,207
5 + 4 is 9.

77
07:21,667 --> 07:31,127
Suppose you have two vectors, you have no information
on their direction, but you do know
that the magnitude of one is four and the magnitude
of the other is five, that's all you know.

78
07:31,727 --> 07:40,687
Then the magnitude of the sum vector could be nine if they
are both in the same direction, that's the maximum,
or it could be one if they're in opposite direction.

79
07:41,017 --> 07:46,227
So then you have a whole range of possibilities
because you do not know the direction.

80
07:46,827 --> 07:52,627
So the adding and the subtraction of vectors
is way more complicated than just scalars.

81
07:54,467 --> 08:08,367
As we have seen that the sum of vectors can be represented
by one vector, equally, can we
take one vector and we can replace it
by the sum of others.

82
08:08,557 --> 08:11,307
And we call that decomposition of a vector.

83
08:11,757 --> 08:19,787
And that's going to be very important in 801,
and I want you to follow this therefore quite
closely.

84
08:20,927 --> 08:25,927
I have a vector which is in three-dimensional space.

85
08:29,577 --> 08:31,277
This is my Z axis.

86
08:34,627 --> 08:39,007
This is my X axis, Y axis and Z axis.

87
08:39,197 --> 08:48,217
This is the origin O and here is a point P
and I have a vector OP.

88
08:49,797 --> 08:50,967
That's the vector.

89
08:52,147 --> 08:57,747
And what I do now, I project this vector
onto the three axes, X, Y and Z.

90
08:58,647 --> 09:01,017
So there we go.

91
09:04,777 --> 09:07,787
Each one has its own method of doing this.

92
09:11,617 --> 09:12,547
Okay.

93
09:16,387 --> 09:17,487
There we are.

94
09:18,297 --> 09:21,427
I call this vector vector A.

95
09:26,887 --> 09:32,457
Let this angle be theta, and this angle be phi.

96
09:34,587 --> 09:40,987
Notice that the projection of A on the Y-axis
has here a number which I call A of Y.

97
09:41,657 --> 09:46,057
This number is A of X, and this number here is A of Z.

98
09:46,827 --> 09:50,217
Simply the projection of that vector onto the three axes.

99
09:51,137 --> 09:55,977
We now introduce what we call unit vectors.

100
09:56,307 --> 10:02,877
Unit vectors are always pointing in the direction
of the positive axis, and the unit vector in the X direction

101
10:04,407 --> 10:11,067
is this one, it has a length one,
and we write for it X roof. Roof always means unit vector.

102
10:11,797 --> 10:15,587
And this is the unit vector in the Y direction.

103
10:16,577 --> 10:22,157
And this is the unit vector in the Z direction.

104
10:23,617 --> 10:30,677
And now I'm going to rewrite vector A
in terms of the three components that we have here.

105
10:31,447 --> 10:45,357
So the vector A, I'm going to write as
A of X times X roof plus A of Y times Y roof
plus A of Z times Z roof.

106
10:46,107 --> 10:51,057
And this A of X times X is really a vector
that runs from the origin to this point.

107
10:52,007 --> 10:55,247
So we could put in that as a vector if you want to.

108
10:55,457 --> 10:58,497
This makes it the vector. This is that vector.

109
10:58,817 --> 11:09,337
A of Y times Oh, sorry, it is A of X, it's this one.
A of Y times Y roof is this one.
And A of Z times Z roof is this one.

110
11:10,587 --> 11:17,037
And so the three green vectors added together
are exactly identical to the vector OP.

111
11:17,347 --> 11:21,517
So we have decomposed one vector into three
directions.

112
11:22,047 --> 11:26,817
And we will see that very often this is of great use in 801.

113
11:27,437 --> 11:39,167
The magnitude of the vector is the square root
of AX squared plus AY squared plus AZ squared.

114
11:40,807 --> 11:50,307
And so we can take a simple example.
For instance, I take a vector A.

115
11:51,497 --> 11:54,997
So this is just an example to see this in action.

116
11:55,697 --> 12:02,057
And we call A three X roof.

117
12:02,807 --> 12:08,487
So A of X is three minus five Y roof.

118
12:09,717 --> 12:12,647
plus six Z roof.

119
12:13,357 --> 12:24,517
So that means that it's three units in this direction.
It is five units in this direction in the minus Y direction
and six in the plus Z direction.

120
12:25,017 --> 12:29,917
That makes up a vector and I call that vector A.

121
12:31,247 --> 12:39,017
What is the magnitude of that vector, which I always write down
with vertical bars? If I put two bars on one side,
that's always the magnitude.

122
12:39,477 --> 12:42,037
Or sometimes I simply leave the arrow off.

123
12:42,477 --> 12:47,157
But to be always on the safe side,
I like this idea that you know it's really the magnitude.

124
12:47,657 --> 12:49,597
It becomes a scalar when you do that.

125
12:50,747 --> 13:01,987
So that would be the square root of three square is nine,
five square is 25, six square is 36.
So that's the square root of 70.

126
13:02,327 --> 13:07,247
And suppose I asked you what is theta?
It's uniquely determined, of course.

127
13:07,247 --> 13:10,277
This vector is uniquely determined in three-dimensional space.

128
13:10,547 --> 13:13,137
So you should be able to find phi and theta.

129
13:13,577 --> 13:19,127
Well, the cosine of theta, see this angle here
is 90 degrees, projection.

130
13:20,007 --> 13:24,367
So the cosine of theta is A of Z divided by A itself.

131
13:24,967 --> 13:35,747
So the cosine of theta equals A of Z
divided by A itself, which in our case
would be 6 divided by the square root of 70.

132
13:36,407 --> 13:37,457
And you can do phi.

133
13:38,007 --> 13:41,777
This is just simply a matter of manipulating
some numbers.

134
13:43,827 --> 13:50,697
We now come to a much more difficult part
of vectors, and that is multiplication of vectors.

135
13:59,187 --> 14:02,327
We're not going to need this until October.

136
14:03,397 --> 14:06,117
But I decided we might as well get it over with now.

137
14:06,317 --> 14:19,287
Now that we introduce vectors, you can add and subtract,
you might as well learn about multiplication.
It's sort of the job is done, it's like going to the dentist,
it's a little painful, but it's good for you,
and when it's behind you, the pain disappears.

138
14:19,937 --> 14:27,097
So I'm going to talk about multiplication of vectors,
something that will not come back until October
and later in the course.

139
14:27,847 --> 14:30,217
There are two ways that we multiply vectors.

140
14:30,757 --> 14:38,437
And one is called the dot product,
often also called the scalar product.

141
14:39,257 --> 14:42,937
A dot B, a fat dot.

142
14:43,997 --> 14:58,167
And that's defined as it is a scalar,
A of X times B of X, just the number,
plus A of Y times B of Y, that's another number,
plus A of Z times B of Z, that's another number.

143
14:58,427 --> 14:59,647
It is a scalar.

144
15:00,827 --> 15:02,947
has no longer a direction.

145
15:04,337 --> 15:06,387
That is the dot product.

146
15:07,377 --> 15:11,017
So that's method number one, that's completely legitimate
and you can always use that.

147
15:12,327 --> 15:20,117
There is another way to find the dot product,
depending upon what you're being given,
how the problem is presented to you.

148
15:20,797 --> 15:25,227
If someone gives you the vector A,

149
15:26,207 --> 15:29,837
and you have the vector B,

150
15:30,747 --> 15:38,637
and you happen to know this angle between them,
this angle theta, which has nothing to do with that angle theta,
it's the angle between the two.

151
15:39,397 --> 15:49,417
Then the dot product is also the following,
and you may make may make an attempt to
to prove that.

152
15:50,257 --> 15:53,407
You project the vector B on A.

153
15:55,017 --> 15:56,477
This is that projection.

154
15:58,077 --> 16:03,127
The length of this vector is B cosine theta.

155
16:04,097 --> 16:12,527
And then the dot product is the magnitude of A
times the magnitude of B times the cosine of the angle theta.

156
16:12,807 --> 16:15,187
The two are completely identical.

157
16:15,857 --> 16:20,087
Now you may ask me, you may say, Gee,
how do I know what theta is?

158
16:20,377 --> 16:23,877
How do I know I should take theta this angle,
or maybe I should take theta this angle?

159
16:24,317 --> 16:26,517
I mean, what angle is A making with B?

160
16:26,777 --> 16:34,117
It makes no difference because the cosine
of this angle here is the same as the cosine
of 360 degrees minus theta. So that makes no difference.

161
16:36,087 --> 16:42,577
Sometimes this is faster depending upon how the problem is
presented to you, sometimes the other is faster.

162
16:43,717 --> 16:55,347
You can immediately see by looking at this,
it's easier to see than looking here,
that the dot product can be larger than zero,
it can be equal to zero, and it can be smaller than zero.

163
16:56,077 --> 17:00,817
A and B are by definition always positive,
they are the magnitude.

164
17:01,507 --> 17:06,187
But so it's determined by the cosine of theta.
If the cosine of theta is larger than zero, well, then it's larger than zero.

165
17:07,257 --> 17:09,007
The cosine of theta can be zero.

166
17:09,487 --> 17:18,007
If the angle for theta is pi over 2, in other words,
if the two vectors are perpendicular to each other,
then the dot product is zero.

167
17:18,387 --> 17:25,007
And if this angle theta is between 90 degrees
and 180 degrees, then the cosine is negative.

168
17:25,347 --> 17:31,197
We will see that at work, no pun implied,
when we're going to deal with work in physics.

169
17:31,577 --> 17:35,477
You will see that we can do positive work
and we can do negative work.

170
17:35,947 --> 17:39,297
And that has to do with this dot product.
Work is a dot product.

171
17:41,097 --> 17:48,277
I could do an extremely simple example with you,
the simplest that I can think of.

172
17:48,597 --> 17:54,237
Perhaps it's almost an insult, it's not meant that way.
Suppose

173
17:54,837 --> 17:59,367
we have A. B.

174
17:59,527 --> 18:05,007
And A is the one that you already have on the blackboard there.
Right here, that's A.

175
18:05,647 --> 18:13,207
But B is just 2Y dropped.

176
18:13,627 --> 18:15,977
Two Y roof. That's all it is.

177
18:16,677 --> 18:18,577
Well, what is A. B?

178
18:18,887 --> 18:26,287
A. B, there's no X component of B.
So that becomes zero, this term becomes zero.

179
18:27,357 --> 18:36,497
There is only a Y component of B. So it is minus 5
times plus two. So I get minus 10 because there is no Z component.

180
18:37,027 --> 18:39,057
Simple as that. So it's minus 10.

181
18:41,257 --> 18:44,837
I can give you another example. Example two.

182
18:46,207 --> 18:56,057
Suppose A itself is the unit vector in the Y direction
and B is the unit vector in the Z direction.

183
18:56,647 --> 19:01,017
Then A. B is what?

184
19:01,707 --> 19:02,567
Zero.

185
19:03,587 --> 19:05,117
I want to hear it loud and clear.

186
19:05,377 --> 19:07,497
Zero! Yeah, zero.

187
19:08,067 --> 19:13,017
It is zero. You don't even have to think about anything,
you know that these two are at 90 degrees.

188
19:13,397 --> 19:18,207
If you want to waste your time and want to substitute it in here,
you will see that it comes out to be zero.

189
19:18,567 --> 19:20,507
It should work because clearly,

190
19:21,677 --> 19:26,977
A of Y means that this this this is one.
That's what it means.

191
19:27,427 --> 19:34,007
And B is Z, that means that B of Z, this is one,
and all the others do not exist.

192
19:34,487 --> 19:46,077
Well, I wish you luck with that, and we now go to a
way way more difficult part of multiplication
and that is vector multiplication,
which is called the vector product.

193
19:47,527 --> 19:54,667
or also called, most of the time I refer to it
as the cross product.

194
19:55,897 --> 20:03,427
The cross product is written like so,
A cross B equals C.

195
20:04,047 --> 20:06,507
It's a cross, very clear cross.

196
20:07,517 --> 20:13,957
And I will tell you how I remember, that is method number one.
I'm going to teach you just like with the dot product, two methods.

197
20:14,187 --> 20:19,597
I will tell you method number one, which is the one that always works,
time consuming, but it always works.

198
20:20,817 --> 20:24,497
You write down here a matrix with three rows.

199
20:24,867 --> 20:30,657
The first row is X roof, Y roof, Z roof.

200
20:31,017 --> 20:40,407
The second one is A of X, A of Y, A of Z.
It's important, if A is here first, that that second row must be A.

201
20:40,917 --> 20:47,007
And the third row is then B. B of X, B of Y, B of Z.

202
20:47,477 --> 20:50,607
So these six are numbers, and these are the unit vectors.

203
20:51,827 --> 21:04,177
I repeat this here verbatim. You'll see in a minute why I need that.

204
21:04,847 --> 21:14,267
And I will do the same here.

205
21:15,147 --> 21:16,437
Okay, and now comes the recipe.

206
21:17,427 --> 21:25,587
You take, you go from the upper left hand corner
to the one in this direction.

207
21:26,307 --> 21:29,587
You multiply them all three, and that's a plus sign.

208
21:30,417 --> 21:43,997
So you get AY, so C, which is the cross A cross B equals
AY times BZ times the X roof.

209
21:44,277 --> 21:52,677
But I'm not going to put the X roof in yet, because I have to
subtract this one, minus sign.

210
21:53,157 --> 21:55,447
Which has AZ BY.

211
21:56,237 --> 22:04,247
So it is minus AZ BY and that
is in the direction X.

212
22:05,277 --> 22:07,537
The next one is this one.

213
22:08,487 --> 22:13,397
AZ BX.

214
22:14,837 --> 22:16,287
minus

215
22:17,347 --> 22:22,477
this one. AX BZ.

216
22:26,437 --> 22:29,177
in the direction Y.

217
22:30,027 --> 22:34,527
And last but not least, AX BY

218
22:39,517 --> 22:40,917
minus

219
22:43,817 --> 22:45,487
AY BX.

220
22:50,467 --> 22:55,027
in the direction of the unit vector Z.

221
22:56,617 --> 23:04,367
So this part here is what we call C of X.
It's the X component of this vector.

222
23:05,247 --> 23:11,007
And this we can call C of Y, and this we can call C of Z.

223
23:11,657 --> 23:24,327
So you can also write that vector then that C
equals C of X X roof plus C of Y
Y roof plus C of Z Z roof.

224
23:24,847 --> 23:27,757
That's the cross product of A and B.

225
23:28,727 --> 23:35,247
We will have lots of exercises, lots of chances
you will have on assignment two to play with this a little bit.

226
23:35,497 --> 23:37,117
Now comes my method number two.

227
23:37,547 --> 23:45,527
And method number two is again, as we had with the dot product,
is a geometrical geometrical method.

228
23:54,677 --> 24:05,007
If you know vector A and you know vector B,
and you know that the angle is theta,

229
24:05,717 --> 24:11,417
then the cross product C equals A cross B

230
24:12,097 --> 24:18,627
is the magnitude of A times the magnitude of B
times the sine of theta.

231
24:19,867 --> 24:26,037
Not the cosine of theta, as we had before
with the dot product, it is the sine of theta.

232
24:27,177 --> 24:34,017
So you can already immediately see that this will be zero
if theta is either 0 degrees or 180 degrees.

233
24:34,267 --> 24:37,747
Whereas the dot product was zero
when the angle between them was 90 degrees.

234
24:39,647 --> 24:45,957
This number can be larger than zero, if the sine theta is larger than zero,
it can also be smaller than zero.

235
24:46,387 --> 24:52,457
Now we only have the magnitude of the vector,
and now comes the hardest part, what is the direction of the vector?

236
24:53,527 --> 24:58,597
And that is something that you have to engrave in your mind
and not forget.

237
24:59,127 --> 25:09,577
The direction is found as follows. You take A
because it's first mentioned, and you rotate A over the shortest
possible angle to B.

238
25:10,427 --> 25:14,357
If you had in your hand a cork screw,
and I will show that in a minute,

239
25:14,677 --> 25:20,377
then you turn the cork screw as seen from you seats clockwise,
and the cork screw would go into the blackboard.

240
25:20,847 --> 25:32,047
And if the cork screw goes into the blackboard,
you will see the tail of the vector,
and you will see a cross, a little plus sign,
and therefore we put that like so.

241
25:32,527 --> 25:37,677
A cross product is always perpendicular
to both A and B.

242
25:38,057 --> 25:43,007
But it leaves you with two choices, it can either come out
of the blackboard or it can go in the blackboard.

243
25:43,537 --> 25:47,107
And I just told you which convention to use.

244
25:47,617 --> 25:54,067
And I want to show that to you in a way that
may appeal to you more.

245
25:54,467 --> 26:04,447
This is what I have used before
on my television help sessions that I've given at MIT.

246
26:04,687 --> 26:08,637
I have an apple, not an apple, this is a tomato.
Not a tomato, it's a potato.

247
26:09,717 --> 26:12,367
I have a potato here, and here is a cork screw.

248
26:13,487 --> 26:15,067
There's a cork screw.

249
26:15,547 --> 26:19,427
I'm going to turn the cork screw as seen from your side clockwise.

250
26:20,247 --> 26:28,057
And you'll see that the cork screw goes into the
potato in.

251
26:28,277 --> 26:30,607
That's the direction then of the vector.

252
26:31,127 --> 26:38,437
If we had B cross A, then you take B in your hands
and you wrote it over the shortest angle to A.

253
26:38,807 --> 26:40,717
Now you have to rotate counterclockwise.

254
26:41,297 --> 26:45,337
And when you rotate counterclockwise,
the cork screw comes to you.

255
26:45,487 --> 26:48,527
There you go, and so the vector is now pointing in this direction.

256
26:49,017 --> 26:55,407
And if the vector is pointing towards you,
then we would indicate that with a circle and a dot.

257
26:56,157 --> 27:06,297
Another words for this vector B cross A
would have exactly the same magnitude, no difference,
but it would be coming out of the blackboard.

258
27:06,817 --> 27:15,387
In other words, A cross B equals minus B cross A.

259
27:18,737 --> 27:22,977
Whereas A dot B is the same as B dot A.

260
27:23,387 --> 27:31,637
We will encounter cross products when we deal with torques,
and when we deal with angular momentum, which is not the easiest part of 801.

261
27:33,217 --> 27:45,767
Let's take an extremely simple example.
Again, I don't mean to insult you with such a simple example,
but you will get chances, more advanced chances on your assignment.

262
27:46,507 --> 27:54,987
Suppose I gave the vector A is X roof.

263
27:55,107 --> 27:57,467
It's the unit vector in the X direction.

264
27:57,467 --> 28:01,207
That means A of X is 1, and A of Y is 0, and A of Z is 0.

265
28:01,597 --> 28:06,427
And suppose B is Y roof.

266
28:07,147 --> 28:14,557
That means B of Y is one, and B of A is
B of X is zero, and B of Z is zero.

267
28:15,547 --> 28:20,467
What now is the dot product, the cross product A cross B?

268
28:24,867 --> 28:36,207
Well, you can apply that recipe, but it's much easier
to go to the XYZ axis that we have here.

269
28:37,087 --> 28:41,457
A was in the X direction, the unit vector, and B in the Y direction.

270
28:41,797 --> 28:49,057
I take A in my hand, I rotate over the smallest angle,
which is 90 degrees to Y, and my cork screw will go up.

271
28:49,637 --> 28:56,007
So I know the whole thing already. I know that this cross product
must be Z roof.

272
28:56,427 --> 29:02,157
The magnitude must be one, that's immediately clear,
but I immediately have the direction by using the cork screw rule.

273
29:02,917 --> 29:14,027
Now, if you are very smart, you may say,
aha, you find plus Z only because you have used this coordinate system.

274
29:14,427 --> 29:24,147
If this axis had been X and this one had been Y,
then the cross product and X and Y would be in the minus Z direction.

275
29:24,437 --> 29:26,067
Yeah, you're right.

276
29:26,337 --> 29:28,537
But if you ever do that, I will kill you.

277
29:29,117 --> 29:36,097
You will always, always have to work with what we call
a right-handed coordinate system.

278
29:36,467 --> 29:45,517
And a right-handed coordinate system by definition is one whereby the cross product
of X with Y is Z and not Y minus Z.

279
29:46,087 --> 29:54,267
So whenever you get in the future involved with cross products
and torques and angular momentum, always make yourself an XYZ diagram

280
29:54,767 --> 29:57,077
for which X cross Y is Z.

281
29:57,307 --> 30:05,207
Never ever make it such that X cross Y is minus Z.
You're going to hang yourself because for one thing, that wouldn't work anymore.

282
30:05,757 --> 30:07,457
So be very, very careful.

283
30:07,977 --> 30:15,577
must work, if you use the right hand cork screw rule,
make sure you work with the right-handed coordinate system.

284
30:17,197 --> 30:18,067
All right.

285
30:19,387 --> 30:21,607
Now, the worst part is over.

286
30:22,327 --> 30:33,807
And now I would like to write down for you,
we get we pick up some of the the fruits now, although it will penetrate slowly,
I want to write down for you

287
30:35,657 --> 30:44,877
a equations for a moving particle,
a moving object in three-dimensional space.

288
30:46,357 --> 30:52,257
Very complicated motion, which I
can hardly imagine what it's like.

289
30:52,987 --> 30:59,207
It is a point that's going to move around
in space, and it is this point, P.

290
30:59,717 --> 31:03,487
This point P is going to move around in space.

291
31:04,557 --> 31:13,317
And I call this vector OP, I call that now vector R,
and I give it a sub index T, which indicates it's changing with time.

292
31:13,967 --> 31:20,337
I call this location A of Y, I'm going to call that Y of T.
It's changing with time.

293
31:20,837 --> 31:23,997
I call this X of T. It's going to change with time.

294
31:24,447 --> 31:30,647
And I call this point Z of T, which is going to change with time
because point P is going to move.

295
31:32,187 --> 31:47,267
And so I'm going to write down the vector R
in its most general form that I can do that R which changes with time
is now X of T, which is the same as A of X there before,

296
31:47,447 --> 31:57,687
times X roof plus Y of T
Y roof plus Z of T Z roof.

297
31:58,307 --> 32:06,537
I have decomposed my vector R into three
independent vectors. Each one of those change with time.

298
32:07,647 --> 32:09,817
What is the velocity of this particle?

299
32:10,327 --> 32:19,427
Well, the velocity is the first derivative
of the position. So that is dR

300
32:19,427 --> 32:20,177
dt.

301
32:20,577 --> 32:27,717
So there we go. First the derivative of this one,
which is dx dt X roof.

302
32:28,357 --> 32:38,547
I'm going to write for dx dt X dot because I'm lazy
and I'm going to write for d2x dt squared X double dot.

303
32:38,967 --> 32:45,527
It's often done but not in your book, but it's a notation that I will often use
because otherwise the equation look so clumsy.

304
32:46,197 --> 32:54,177
plus Y dot times Y roof plus Z dot times Z roof.

305
32:54,497 --> 32:56,077
So Z dot is dz dt.

306
32:56,827 --> 33:05,167
What is the acceleration as a function of time?
Well, the acceleration as a function of time equals Dvdt.

307
33:06,147 --> 33:09,887
So that's the second derivative of X versus time.

308
33:10,247 --> 33:22,237
And so that becomes X double dot times X roof
plus Y double dot times Y roof plus Z double dot times Z roof.

309
33:24,357 --> 33:27,557
And look what we have now accomplished.

310
33:28,037 --> 33:31,227
It looks like minor, but it's going to be big later on.

311
33:31,737 --> 33:34,507
We have a point P going in three-dimensional space.

312
33:35,487 --> 33:46,247
And here we have the entire behavior
of the object as it moves its projection along the X-axis.

313
33:47,097 --> 33:52,667
This is the position. This is its velocity,
and this is its acceleration.

314
33:53,317 --> 33:57,997
And here you see the entire behavior
on the Z axis.

315
33:58,527 --> 34:05,447
This is the position on the Z axis. This is the velocity component
in the Z direction, and this is the acceleration in the Z axis.

316
34:05,657 --> 34:07,047
And here you have the Y.

317
34:07,347 --> 34:16,427
In other words, we have now a three-dimensional motion,
we have cut into three one-dimensional motions.

318
34:17,107 --> 34:18,897
This is a one-dimensional motion.

319
34:19,377 --> 34:26,217
This is a behavior only along the X-axis, and this is a behavior
only along the Y-axis, and this is a behavior only along the Z-axis.

320
34:26,627 --> 34:33,307
And the three together make up the actual motion of that particle.

321
34:34,737 --> 34:38,847
So what have we gained now? It looks like this looks like a mathematical zoo.

322
34:38,847 --> 34:42,677
You would say, well, if this is what it's going to be like, it's going to be hell.

323
34:43,937 --> 34:50,277
Well, not quite. In fact, it's going to help you a great deal.

324
34:51,677 --> 35:03,287
First of all, if I throw up a tennis ball in class like this,
then the whole trajectory is the whole trajectory is in one plane, in the vertical plane.

325
35:03,727 --> 35:11,537
So, even though it is in three dimensions, we can always represent it
by two axes, by two dimensionally, a Y- axis and an X- axis.

326
35:12,037 --> 35:16,527
So already, the three-dimensional problem often becomes a two-dimensional problem.

327
35:18,107 --> 35:28,987
We will with great success analyze these trajectories
by decomposing this very complicated motion. Imagine what an incredibly complicated arc that is.

328
35:29,497 --> 35:39,967
And yet we are going to decompose it into a motion in the X direction,
which lives a life of its own, independent of the motion in the Y direction, which lives a life of its own.

329
35:40,467 --> 35:45,527
And of course, you always have to combine the two to know what the particle is doing.

330
35:48,497 --> 35:58,877
We know the equations so well from our last lecture
from one dimensional motion with a constant acceleration.

331
36:00,557 --> 36:04,557
The first line tells you what the X position is as a function of time.

332
36:05,547 --> 36:08,797
The index T tells you that it's changing with time.

333
36:09,277 --> 36:19,077
It is the position at T equals zero plus the velocity at T equals 0 times T
plus 1/2 AX T squared if there is an acceleration in the X direction.

334
36:19,527 --> 36:26,567
The velocity immediately comes from taking the derivative of this function,
and the acceleration comes from taking the derivative of this function.

335
36:27,697 --> 36:50,497
Now, if we have a motion which is more complicated,
which reaches out to two or three dimensions, we can decompose the motion in three
perpendicular axes, and you can replace every X here by a Y,
which gives you the entire behavior in the Y direction,
and if you want to know the behavior in the Z direction, you replace every X here by Z.

336
36:50,907 --> 37:01,067
And then you have decomposed the motion in three
directions. Each of them are linear.

337
37:01,947 --> 37:03,637
And that's what I want to do now.

338
37:04,357 --> 37:18,057
I'm going to throw up an object,
a golf ball or an apple in 26 100.

339
37:19,437 --> 37:28,427
And we know that it's in a vertical plane, so we have we only deal with a two-dimensional problem.
This being I call this my X-axis.

340
37:29,837 --> 37:33,127
And I'm going to call this my Y-axis.

341
37:33,707 --> 37:39,197
I call this increasing value of X,
and I call this increasing value of Y.

342
37:39,847 --> 37:48,817
I could have called this increasing value of Y.
Today I've decided to call this increasing value of Y. I'm free in that choice.

343
37:49,917 --> 37:59,497
I throw up an object at a certain angle
and I see a motion like this. Boing and it comes back to the ground.

344
38:01,777 --> 38:12,137
My initial speed when I threw it
was V0 and the angle here is alpha.

345
38:14,447 --> 38:22,957
The X component of that initial velocity
is V0 cosine alpha.

346
38:23,687 --> 38:30,447
And the Y component equals V0
sine alpha.

347
38:31,347 --> 38:37,947
So that's the begin velocity of in the X direction,
and this is the begin velocity in the Y direction.

348
38:39,797 --> 38:48,357
A little later in time, that object
is here at point P.

349
38:49,417 --> 38:53,957
And this is now the position vector which we have called R of T.

350
38:54,917 --> 38:56,417
That's this vector.

351
38:59,547 --> 39:02,937
That's the vector that is moving through space.

352
39:03,847 --> 39:09,567
At this moment in time, X of T
is here.

353
39:10,247 --> 39:17,407
And at this moment in time, Y of T
is here.

354
39:19,677 --> 39:25,167
And now you're going to see for the first time
a big gain

355
39:26,027 --> 39:33,737
by the way that we have divided the
two axes, which live an independent life.

356
39:33,897 --> 39:34,747
First X.

357
39:35,517 --> 39:44,717
I want to know everything about X that has to be known.
I want to know where it is at any moment in time,
velocity and the acceleration only in X.

358
39:46,317 --> 39:48,847
First, I want to know that at T equals zero.

359
39:51,017 --> 39:53,297
Well, at T equals zero, I look there.

360
39:53,817 --> 40:01,167
X0, that's the I can choose that to be zero.
So I can say X0 is zero, that's my free choice.

361
40:02,287 --> 40:05,007
Now I need V0 X. What is the velocity?

362
40:05,417 --> 40:14,077
The velocity at T equals zero, which we have called V0 X
is this velocity, V0 cosine alpha.

363
40:15,237 --> 40:18,317
And is not going to change.

364
40:18,597 --> 40:23,047
Why is it not going to change? Because there is no A of X.

365
40:23,577 --> 40:33,267
So this term here is zero. We only have this one.
So at all moments in time, the velocity in the X direction is V0
cosine alpha.

366
40:33,947 --> 40:37,257
And the A of X equals zero.

367
40:41,187 --> 40:46,207
Now, I want to do the same in the X direction
for time T.

368
40:47,657 --> 40:49,687
Well, at time T,

369
40:50,467 --> 40:52,557
I look there at the first equation.

370
40:53,937 --> 40:55,207
Uh, there it is.

371
40:55,517 --> 40:56,807
X0 is zero.

372
40:57,117 --> 41:09,317
I know V0 X, that is V0 cosine alpha.
So X of T is V0 cosine alpha times T.
But there is no acceleration.

373
41:09,807 --> 41:10,897
So that's it.

374
41:11,357 --> 41:17,847
What is Vx of T? The velocity in the X direction
at any moment in time.

375
41:18,287 --> 41:22,277
That's that that that is that equation. That is simply V0 X.

376
41:22,547 --> 41:24,007
It is not changing in time.

377
41:24,577 --> 41:31,927
because there is no acceleration. So the initial velocity
at T0 is the same as T seconds later.

378
41:32,277 --> 41:33,637
And the acceleration is zero.

379
41:34,117 --> 41:38,947
Now, we're going to do this for the Y direction.

380
41:40,157 --> 41:44,047
And now you begin to see the gain for the decomposition.

381
41:45,077 --> 41:48,867
In the Y direction, we change the X by a Y.

382
41:50,017 --> 41:52,297
And so we do it first at T equals zero.

383
41:53,627 --> 41:55,107
So look there.

384
41:55,437 --> 41:57,607
This becomes Y0, I call that zero.

385
41:58,027 --> 42:03,387
I can always call my origin zero. I get V0 Y * T.

386
42:04,167 --> 42:08,947
Well, V0 Y is this quantity, is V0 sin alpha.

387
42:11,127 --> 42:17,217
V0 sin alpha. This is V0 sin alpha.

388
42:17,547 --> 42:27,357
That is the velocity at time zero and this is zero.
At time zero, this is zero at time zero.

389
42:27,827 --> 42:34,077
What is the acceleration in the Y direction at time zero?

390
42:34,637 --> 42:37,367
What is the acceleration? That has to do with gravity.

391
42:38,117 --> 42:40,437
There is no acceleration in the X direction.

392
42:40,917 --> 42:43,097
But you better believe it there is one in the Y direction.

393
42:43,647 --> 42:47,337
So only when we deal with the Y equations does this acceleration come in.

394
42:47,907 --> 42:49,837
Not at all when we deal with the X direction.

395
42:51,077 --> 43:02,467
Well, if we call the acceleration due to gravity G
equals plus 9.80 and I always call it G,
what would be the acceleration in the Y direction?

396
43:02,467 --> 43:06,247
Given the fact that I call this increasing value of Y.

397
43:06,497 --> 43:07,277
-G"

398
43:08,337 --> 43:09,127
"Negative G"

399
43:09,477 --> 43:16,087
Minus 9.8, which I will also say
always call minus G because my G is always positive.

400
43:16,807 --> 43:18,907
So it is minus G.

401
43:19,817 --> 43:23,847
So that tells the story at T equals zero in the Y direction.

402
43:24,377 --> 43:27,717
And now we have to complete it at time T equals T.

403
43:29,177 --> 43:33,947
At time T equals T, we have the first line there.

404
43:34,477 --> 43:35,917
Y0 is zero.

405
43:36,197 --> 43:48,497
So we have Y as a function of time. Y0 is zero.
So we don't have to work with that. So I get V0 Y times T.

406
43:48,877 --> 44:03,017
So I get V0 sin alpha times T
plus 1/2 but it is minus 1/2 GT squared.

407
44:03,547 --> 44:16,447
And now I get the velocity in the Y direction at time T,
that is my second line. That is going to be V0
sin alpha minus GT.

408
44:17,297 --> 44:22,497
And the acceleration in the Y direction at any moment in time
equals minus G.

409
44:23,247 --> 44:33,807
And now I have done all I can to completely decompose
this complicated motion into two entirely independent one-dimensional motions.

410
44:34,317 --> 44:39,557
And the next lecture, we're going to use this again and again and again and again.

411
44:39,767 --> 44:51,737
This lecture is not over yet, but I want you to know that this is what we're going to apply
for many lectures to come, the decomposition of a complicated
trajectory into two simple ones.

412
44:52,877 --> 44:56,577
Now when you look at this, there is something quite remarkable.

413
44:57,007 --> 45:06,557
And the remarkable thing is that the velocity in the X direction
throughout this whole trajectory, if there is no air drag, if there is no friction, is not changing.

414
45:07,167 --> 45:10,327
It's only the velocity in the Y direction that is changing.

415
45:11,007 --> 45:18,297
It means if I throw up this golf ball, I throw it up like this,
and it has a certain component in X direction, a certain velocity.

416
45:18,667 --> 45:26,217
If I move myself with exactly that same velocity,
with exactly the same horizontal velocity, I could catch the ball here.

417
45:26,777 --> 45:29,597
It would it would have to come back exactly in my hands.

418
45:30,177 --> 45:39,027
That is because there is only an acceleration in the Y direction,
but the motion in the Y direction is completely independent of the X direction.

419
45:39,567 --> 45:42,907
The X direction doesn't even know what's going on in the Y direction.

420
45:43,207 --> 45:51,477
In the X direction, if I throw an object like this,
the X direction simply very boringly moves with a constant velocity.

421
45:52,177 --> 45:54,977
There is no time dependence.

422
45:55,407 --> 46:01,887
And the Y direction on its own does its own thing. It goes up,
comes to a halt and it stop.

423
46:02,577 --> 46:07,617
And of course, the actual motion is the sum, the superposition of the two.

424
46:08,597 --> 46:17,367
We have tried to find a way to demonstrate this quite bizarre
behavior, which is not so intuitive that the X direction really lives a life of its own.

425
46:21,647 --> 46:27,647
And the way we want to do that
is as follows.

426
46:28,567 --> 46:36,947
We have here a golf ball, a
gun, we can shoot up the golf ball.

427
46:37,557 --> 46:45,417
And we do that in such a way that the
golf ball, if we do it correctly, exactly comes back here.

428
46:45,987 --> 46:49,527
That's not easy. That takes hours and hours of adjustment.

429
46:50,427 --> 46:54,847
The golf ball goes up and comes back here.

430
46:55,347 --> 46:58,047
Not here, not here, not there. That's easy.

431
46:58,307 --> 47:01,807
You can shoot it up a little at an angle and the golf ball will come back here.

432
47:03,177 --> 47:06,897
Once we have achieved that that the golf ball will come back there,

433
47:07,827 --> 47:11,007
then I'm going to give this car a push.

434
47:11,897 --> 47:16,547
And the moment that it passes through this switch,
the golf ball will fire.

435
47:17,197 --> 47:21,667
So the golf ball will go straight up
as seen from the car.

436
47:22,207 --> 47:27,677
But it has an horizontal velocity which is exactly the same horizontal velocity as the car.

437
47:27,947 --> 47:34,227
So the car is like my hand, as the golf ball goes like this,
the car stays always exactly under the golf ball.

438
47:34,917 --> 47:42,667
Always exactly under the golf ball, and if all works well,
the ball ends up exactly on the car again.

439
47:43,887 --> 47:53,367
Let me first show you, otherwise, if that doesn't work, of course, it's all over,
that if we shoot the ball straight up, that it comes back here.

440
47:53,667 --> 47:57,847
If it doesn't do that, I don't even have to try this
more complicated experiment.

441
47:59,457 --> 48:02,627
So here's the golf ball. I'm going to fire the gun now.

442
48:03,937 --> 48:04,687
Close.

443
48:06,227 --> 48:08,147
Close.

444
48:09,747 --> 48:12,217
Reasonably close.

445
48:13,107 --> 48:15,937
Well, since it's only reasonably close,

446
48:16,497 --> 48:18,067
Perhaps

447
48:22,447 --> 48:26,017
Perhaps it would help if we give it a little bit
of leeway.

448
48:26,547 --> 48:28,037
There goes the gun.

449
48:30,567 --> 48:32,897
Here comes the ball.

450
48:35,607 --> 48:39,307
And this is just in case.

451
48:43,887 --> 48:45,027
Tape it down.

452
48:46,607 --> 48:50,497
So as I'm going to push this now,

453
48:50,867 --> 48:57,417
Give it a push. The gun will be triggered
when the middle of the car is here.

454
48:58,127 --> 49:02,747
You've seen how high that ball goes. So that ball will go.

455
49:02,917 --> 49:08,307
And depending upon how hard I push it, they may meet here
or they may meet there.

456
49:11,307 --> 49:13,517
You ready for this?

457
49:14,237 --> 49:15,237
You ready?

458
49:15,567 --> 49:16,167
Yes.

459
49:16,437 --> 49:17,107
I'm ready.

460
49:17,397 --> 49:21,747
(Sound of cart rolling and ball firing)
Physics works.

461
49:25,367 --> 49:26,527
See you Wednesday.
