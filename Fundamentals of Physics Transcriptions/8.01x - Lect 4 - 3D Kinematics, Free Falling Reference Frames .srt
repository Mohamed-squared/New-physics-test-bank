1
00:00:00,878 --> 00:00:06,988
Today, we're going to take it quite easy.

2
00:00:07,938 --> 00:00:10,568
I also have to take it a little easy

3
00:00:10,568 --> 00:00:15,998
because my voice maybe feathering out if I'm not careful.

4
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:20,418
We're going to apply today what we have learned.

5
00:00:20,418 --> 00:00:23,768
So there's nothing new, but it's applications.

6
00:00:24,388 --> 00:00:27,738
And that's important, things that you can let it sink in.

7
00:00:29,828 --> 00:00:35,428
We have here a trajectory of a golf ball or a tennis ball in 26100.

8
00:00:36,258 --> 00:00:37,978
We shoot it up at an angle alpha.

9
00:00:38,728 --> 00:00:43,368
The horizontal component in the X direction is v0 cosine alpha.

10
00:00:44,098 --> 00:00:46,878
And the vertical component is v0 sine alpha.

11
00:00:47,888 --> 00:00:50,118
It reaches the highest point at P

12
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:53,358
and it returns to the ground at point S.

13
00:00:53,978 --> 00:00:55,038
This is the

14
00:00:56,178 --> 00:00:59,888
increasing Y direction, and this is the increasing X direction.

15
01:00,888 --> 00:01:07,858
We're going to use very heavily the equations that you see here that are so familiar with us.

16
01:08,268 --> 00:01:17,898
These are the one-dimensional equations in X direction when there is where there is no acceleration and the one-dimensional equations in the Y direction where there is acceleration.

17
01:18,858 --> 00:01:25,118
In order to use these equations, we need all these constants X0, v0x and v0y.

18
01:25,848 --> 00:01:27,328
We've seen those last time.

19
01:27,918 --> 00:01:32,748
I choose for X0, I choose zero arbitrarily, also for Y0.

20
01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,208
The velocity in the X direction will never change.

21
01:36,208 --> 00:01:39,938
This v0x will always remain v0 cosine alpha.

22
01:40,318 --> 00:01:48,818
The velocity in the Y direction, however, in the beginning at T equals 0 is v0 sin alpha, and that one will change because there is here this T.

23
01:48,818 --> 00:01:54,718
And that's why the velocity is going to change this T will do it.

24
01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,148
And the acceleration in the Y direction,

25
01:57,148 --> 00:02:11,638
 Since this is increasing value of Y is going to be negative 9.8, since I call always 9.8 plus since I always call g plus 9.8, this is minus G.

26
02:13,448 --> 00:02:20,998
I now want to ask first the question that you may never have seen answered, what is the shape of this?

27
02:21,348 --> 00:02:24,578
Well, we can go to equation number three there,

28
02:25,918 --> 00:02:47,038
and we can write down, this is equation number three, that Y as a function of time equals v0yt, so that is v0 sin alpha times t minus 12 GT squared.

29
02:47,678 --> 00:02:48,828
That's the equation in Y.

30
02:48,828 --> 00:02:50,548
I go to equation number one,

31
02:51,658 --> 00:03:04,768
and I write down X at any moment in time equals v0x times T. So that is v0 cosine alpha times t.

32
03:05,298 --> 00:03:09,908
Now I eliminate T, and the best way to do that is to do it here,

33
03:09,908 --> 00:03:18,728
to write for t X divided by V0 cosine alpha.

34
03:19,538 --> 00:03:27,918
Now I can drop all sub indexes T, because we're now going to see X versus Y. We're going to eliminate T.

35
03:28,548 --> 00:03:37,368
So this time here, I'm going to substitute in here and in there, and so I'm going to get Y equals.

36
03:38,228 --> 00:03:42,928
There's a V0 here and there's a V0 there, that cancels.

37
03:43,348 --> 00:03:47,018
There's a sign alpha here and a cosine alpha there.

38
03:47,018 --> 00:03:52,968
That makes it the tangent of alpha, and then I have here an X.

39
03:53,878 --> 00:04:07,728
Then I get minus 12 g times this squared X squared divided by V0 cosine alpha squared.

40
04:08,228 --> 00:04:09,768
And now look very carefully.

41
04:10,608 --> 00:04:22,418
Y is a constant times X minus another constant times X squared.

42
04:22,658 --> 00:04:23,888
That is a parabola.

43
04:24,138 --> 00:04:31,118
It's a second order equation in X and it's a parabola and the parabola has this shape.

44
04:31,908 --> 00:04:38,898
So you see now by eliminating the time that we have here a parabola.

45
04:39,888 --> 00:04:43,718
Now I want to massage this quite a bit further today.

46
04:44,238 --> 00:04:56,968
I would like to know at what time the object here comes to a halt, to its highest point, it comes to a hold in the Y direction, it comes to the highest point,

47
04:56,968 --> 00:04:59,538
and I want to know how high that is.

48
05:00,678 --> 00:05:09,268
Well, the best way to do is to go to equation four and to say to equation four, when are you zero?

49
05:09,778 --> 00:05:15,868
Because that is the moment that the velocity in the Y direction becomes zero. It must be at its highest point then.

50
05:16,578 --> 00:05:22,968
So in order to find for us the position of the highest point P,

51
05:24,668 --> 00:05:31,038
we first ask ourselves the question from equation number four,

52
05:32,468 --> 00:05:35,768
When is the velocity in the Y direction zero?

53
05:36,808 --> 00:05:47,468
And that then becomes V0 Y which is V0 sin alpha minus GT.

54
05:48,068 --> 00:05:58,398
And out pops that T at point P is going to be V0 sin alpha divided by G.

55
05:58,998 --> 00:06:02,678
That's the time that it takes for the object to reach the highest point.

56
06:03,298 --> 00:06:07,838
Where is it then? What is the highest point above the ground?

57
06:08,228 --> 00:06:13,798
Well, now you have to go to equation number three and you have to substitute this time in there.

58
06:14,688 --> 00:06:34,928
So that highest point h, which is Y at the time T of P equals V0 Y T, that is V0 times the sign of alpha, but I have to multiply it by this time.

59
06:35,138 --> 00:06:41,068
And so I get another V0 sign alpha and I get a G here.

60
06:41,218 --> 00:06:42,168
minus

61
06:43,428 --> 00:06:44,358
GT.

62
06:45,338 --> 00:06:49,478
My Oh, no, no. This equation. minus half GT squared.

63
06:49,878 --> 00:07:02,118
minus 12 G times this one squared, which is V0 sin alpha squared divided by G.

64
07:03,718 --> 00:07:05,758
divided by G squared.

65
07:06,378 --> 00:07:10,128
Because there's a G here, you see. So you square the whole thing, it is T squared.

66
07:10,808 --> 00:07:12,178
You lose 1 G.

67
07:13,238 --> 00:07:32,968
And you will find then that the highest point, let's write it down here so that we don't block that blackboard. The highest point in the sky equals V0 sin alpha squared divided by 2G.

68
07:34,848 --> 00:07:36,648
Okay.

69
07:37,628 --> 00:07:39,108
That is the highest point.

70
07:39,108 --> 00:07:45,648
Let's give that some color because we may want to keep that.

71
07:47,538 --> 00:08:00,358
Is it reasonable that that point, that highest point in the sky gets higher when V0 is higher? Of course. If I shoot it up at a higher speed, of course it will get higher.

72
08:00,658 --> 00:08:03,978
So it is completely intuitive that V0 is upstairs.

73
08:04,818 --> 00:08:10,888
If I increase the angle from a small angle to larger and larger and larger.

74
08:11,398 --> 00:08:14,288
Is it reasonable that it will get higher? Of course.

75
08:14,928 --> 00:08:25,678
You all feel in your stomach that the highest possible value you can get is by when you make alpha 90 degrees for a given velocity. That's the highest it will go in the sky.

76
08:26,278 --> 00:08:28,538
So clearly this is also very pleasing.

77
08:29,078 --> 00:08:34,188
If you did the experiment on the moon with the same initial speed, it will go much higher.

78
08:34,568 --> 00:08:38,408
So you're also happy to see that this G here is downstairs.

79
08:39,238 --> 00:08:40,748
So that makes sense.

80
08:43,158 --> 00:08:48,868
At what time will the object be at point S?

81
08:49,538 --> 00:08:51,868
Now there are two ways that you can do that.

82
08:52,398 --> 00:08:58,518
You either go to this equation number three and you ask equation number three, when are you zero?

83
08:59,018 --> 00:09:00,468
It will give you two answers.

84
09:01,138 --> 00:09:08,828
It will say, I'm zero here at this time, and I'm zero at that time, and those are the two times that you want, and this is the one you pick.

85
09:09,538 --> 00:09:10,748
That's perfectly fine.

86
09:10,998 --> 00:09:19,448
I think there's a faster way to do it. And that's the following. This is a parabola, so it's completely symmetric about the vertical about P.

87
09:19,848 --> 00:09:24,718
So to climb up from O to P must take the same amount of time as to go down from P to S.

88
09:25,148 --> 00:09:42,678
And so I claim that the time to reach point S must be twice the time to reach point P, and therefore it's going to be 2V0 sine alpha divided by G.

89
09:44,628 --> 00:09:51,438
But now, we want to look again whether the V zeros and the sign alpha have the right place.

90
09:52,058 --> 00:59,998
Indeed, if I increased the speed, I would expect it to take longer before it reaches S.

91
10:01,218 --> 10:07,948
If I give it a larger speed, it will come out farther and obviously the time will take longer.

92
10:08,398 --> 10:12,548
If I do it at a higher angle, it will also take longer.

93
10:13,058 --> 10:15,978
And if I do it on the moon, it will also take longer.

94
10:16,398 --> 10:26,768
So this makes sense. These equations are pleasing in terms of their the way that V0 and sin alpha appear in the equations.

95
10:27,518 --> 10:34,558
But now comes an important point, which I'm going to use throughout this lecture. I want to know what OS is.

96
10:35,788 --> 10:37,358
The distance OS.

97
10:37,718 --> 10:42,488
I shoot it up and it hits the floor again. What is that distance that it travels?

98
10:43,138 --> 10:50,358
Well, for that, I need equation number one. It is V0x times the time.

99
10:51,108 --> 10:56,678
And V0x is um V0 cosine alpha.

100
10:57,868 --> 11:01,798
So we get V0 cosine alpha.

101
11:02,278 --> 11:05,978
Times the time to hit it, that is 2v0 sin alpha.

102
11:06,598 --> 11:07,948
So I get a two here.

103
11:08,948 --> 11:10,628
I get a sine alpha.

104
11:11,688 --> 11:12,938
And I get a G here.

105
11:14,338 --> 11:17,168
And I have another V zero there.

106
11:17,558 --> 11:32,548
And so the answer is V0 squared times the sign of the double angle, remember two cosine alpha sin alpha is the sign of 2 alpha divided by G.

107
11:33,178 --> 11:34,348
And this is OS.

108
11:35,518 --> 11:42,498
And I'm going to need this a lot. This reminds me not to remove it.

109
11:44,108 --> 11:49,238
Now, I sort of wonder and you should too.

110
11:49,758 --> 11:54,628
Why is it that the highest point in the sky has a V0 squared?

111
11:55,238 --> 11:59,448
And why is the farthest point also? Why does it also have a V0 square?

112
11:59,878 --> 12:02,558
There must be a way that you can reason that.

113
12:03,348 --> 12:06,248
Why is it not just V0? Why is it V0 square?

114
12:06,848 --> 12:09,418
Well, I'll let you argue about the highest point.

115
12:09,928 --> 12:14,658
And I'll give you a good reason for the distance OS.

116
12:15,288 --> 12:16,818
Don't look at the equations.

117
12:17,368 --> 12:22,908
Just simply think for a change.

118
12:23,328 --> 12:24,618
Don't look at the equations.

119
12:25,718 --> 12:28,788
I double the speed.

120
12:29,798 --> 12:41,818
If I double the speed, then it's quite reasonable that the time that it takes for the object to reach the ground will double.

121
12:41,818 --> 12:42,878
But,

122
12:44,588 --> 12:51,758
while the time that it flies has doubled, the horizontal velocity has also doubled.

123
12:52,148 --> 12:56,718
And so the distance that it will travel in horizontal direction is four times that.

124
12:57,588 --> 13:05,898
Twice because the time has doubled, and another factor of two because the horizontal component has also doubled.

125
13:06,268 --> 13:10,408
So that's why you see V0 square there, completely pleasing.

126
13:12,338 --> 13:17,808
This tells you immediately that the if you want to throw a ball as far as possible,

127
13:18,728 --> 13:22,668
people who play baseball know that, you should do it at 45 degrees.

128
13:23,498 --> 13:30,858
Because if you throw it at 45 degrees, then this angle 90 degrees and that is one.

129
13:31,268 --> 13:46,708
Of course, in in reality, a baseball player knows better, they give effect to the ball, they deal with air drag, they spin the ball, and then these equations are not valid. This is only in case we deal with with vacuum.

130
13:49,208 --> 13:56,228
I now would like to test some of the results that we have here, we have worked out here.

131
13:56,608 --> 14:05,338
I'm going to shoot a pellet, a metal ball. I'm going to shoot it at various angles.

132
14:05,908 --> 14:08,418
30 degrees, 60 degrees, 45 degrees.

133
14:08,888 --> 14:14,388
And I'm going to make a prediction if I shoot it up from there, where it will hit the table.

134
14:15,728 --> 14:24,768
A measurement is meaningless without knowing the uncertainties.

135
14:25,798 --> 14:27,848
So that's the first thing we have to deal with.

136
14:28,658 --> 14:34,778
The first thing I want to know is what is the velocity of this bullet when it comes out of the spring?

137
14:35,138 --> 14:38,788
And does it vary if I do it three, five, six times in a row?

138
14:38,788 --> 14:42,268
It's not a $20,000 spring gun.

139
14:42,778 --> 14:44,908
So it's likely to vary.

140
14:45,858 --> 14:49,358
And the way I'm going to do that is as follows.

141
14:50,408 --> 15:02,088
If I shoot an object vertically up, that is the maximum value that it can go, when alpha equals 90 degrees,

142
15:02,918 --> 15:11,378
then the sign of alpha is one, then the height is V0 squared divided by 2 G.

143
15:11,918 --> 15:23,728
In other words, if I measure the height, if I shoot it up vertically, and you can measure that for me, you will see how I'm asking you to do that, then we can calculate V0 squared.

144
15:24,768 --> 15:35,278
So the first thing I want to do is to shoot it up vertically, and how are you going to help me to calculate to tell me how high it is?

145
15:35,858 --> 15:38,738
That comes easier than you think.

146
15:40,578 --> 15:44,138
The top part, oh, we removed this.

147
15:44,898 --> 15:52,738
The top part of this stick is 3 meters.

148
15:52,738 --> 15:53,828
The top mark.

149
15:54,698 --> 15:56,628
That very top mark is 3 meters.

150
15:57,088 --> 16:05,778
And all I want you to tell me whether it is yay much above or yay much below, and then we'll estimate that yay much, and then we'll make a guess.

151
16:06,148 --> 16:07,378
And I'll do it twice.

152
16:08,758 --> 16:09,858
So are you ready?

153
16:10,748 --> 16:14,908
Make sure that you can distinguish between above and below, makes a big difference.

154
16:15,368 --> 16:16,238
Yeah?

155
16:18,898 --> 16:19,678
Okay.

156
16:19,988 --> 16:22,278
Three, two, one, zero.

157
16:23,788 --> 16:25,368
Okay, was it higher or lower?

158
16:25,538 --> 16:25,798
Higher.

159
16:26,478 --> 16:26,988
How much?

160
16:28,778 --> 16:29,438
This much?

161
16:29,918 --> 16:31,088
Do we agree?

162
16:31,308 --> 16:32,538
Let's say 5 cm, right?

163
16:32,968 --> 16:34,588
We're going to allow for an uncertainty.

164
16:34,968 --> 16:35,758
I'll do it again.

165
16:36,368 --> 16:38,248
I want to see how well it reproduces.

166
16:39,778 --> 16:42,188
Three, two, 1, 0.

167
16:44,228 --> 16:44,478
Higher.

168
16:46,428 --> 16:47,118
Lower.

169
16:48,568 --> 16:49,478
Higher.

170
16:50,458 --> 16:54,988
So it was 10 cm, 5 cm higher, so we'll take seven.

171
16:56,368 --> 16:59,708
So we will make seven, and we'll have to allow for an uncertainty.

172
17:00,888 --> 17:10,698
So H max is about 3.07.

173
17:11,648 --> 17:13,788
I've done this this morning 20 times.

174
17:14,448 --> 17:20,698
And there were times that the height differed by more than 10 cm, sometimes even 15 cm.

175
17:22,018 --> 17:32,398
I therefore would feel most comfortable if you allow me an uncertainty of 15 cm in that height.

176
17:33,098 --> 17:40,348
Remember, once we start shooting at 30 degrees, there's no way that we can evaluate the velocity anymore. We have to just take this value at face value.

177
17:40,608 --> 17:44,478
This is the way we've measured V zero, and that's it.

178
17:46,128 --> 17:48,278
This is a 5% error.

179
17:50,168 --> 17:51,568
5%.

180
17:52,678 --> 17:55,128
So what now is V0 squared?

181
17:57,108 --> 17:59,498
Well, that's easy to calculate now.

182
18:00,448 --> 18:10,378
V0 squared equals 3.07 times 2 times 9.8.

183
18:10,958 --> 18:13,618
Oh, my calculator was off. That's a detail.

184
18:14,498 --> 18:24,138
Um 3.07 * 2 * 9.8 That is 60.17.

185
18:24,138 --> 18:26,078
I'd like you to check that.

186
18:26,538 --> 18:37,808
60.17 plus an error of 5%, that is an error of three. So you might as well make this 60.2.

187
18:38,218 --> 18:40,478
Would you please confirm that I didn't make a mistake?

188
18:40,768 --> 18:44,148
3.07 is H max.

189
18:44,778 --> 18:54,378
I multiply it by 2 by 9.9. That is 60.2, is a 5% error, and a 5% error is indeed three.

190
18:54,908 --> 18:57,938
This is meter squared per second squared.

191
18:58,898 --> 19:04,488
I don't care what V0 is, because if we're going to measure OS, all I need is V0 squared.

192
19:05,098 --> 19:12,238
And if you at home are going to calculate what the height will be at the various angles, all you need is V0 squared.

193
19:12,788 --> 19:14,638
So I'm not even interested in V0.

194
19:14,948 --> 19:17,158
I'll just stick to V0 squared.

195
19:17,398 --> 19:22,778
And V0 squared will have exactly the same uncertainty. We'll have an uncertainty of 5%.

196
19:23,078 --> 19:25,048
because it comes immediately from H.

197
19:25,248 --> 19:26,778
So you're not going to change that.

198
19:28,728 --> 19:32,908
Okay, so so much for the uncertainty in V0 squared.

199
19:33,758 --> 19:37,068
Now I'm going to set the angle at 45 degrees.

200
19:38,018 --> 19:44,808
But how accurately can I do that? I don't think I can do that any better than one degree.

201
19:45,798 --> 19:51,798
I'll try to do the best I can, but I can't really guarantee you that I'm accurate to one degree.

202
19:52,848 --> 20:02,178
So now comes the question, what happens with the sign of two alpha? Because we're going to measure OS.

203
20:02,718 --> 20:05,538
What happens with the sign of 2 alpha?

204
20:05,848 --> 20:11,838
The sign of 90 degrees is 1.0000.

205
20:12,408 --> 20:16,138
But what would be the sign of 88 degrees?

206
20:16,778 --> 20:20,808
That is the value that I cannot exclude if I'm off by one degree.

207
20:21,878 --> 20:27,408
And that value is 0. 9994.

208
20:28,388 --> 20:42,948
That is so close to one that it is only off by 0.6%. 0.06%. And that is so low compared to 5%, forget it.

209
20:43,638 --> 20:44,988
Forget the error in alpha.

210
20:45,748 --> 20:47,028
We can completely forget it.

211
20:47,338 --> 20:48,848
There's a reason for that.

212
20:49,348 --> 20:55,318
When alpha is 45 degrees, then two alpha is 90 degrees.

213
20:55,858 --> 20:58,428
And the sign curve goes like this at 90 degrees.

214
20:58,648 --> 21:00,428
It's almost flat here.

215
21:00,708 --> 21:04,598
So even if you're off in angle by a little bit, you're still very close to one. That's the reason.

216
21:05,188 --> 21:09,538
So all we have to worry about is the uncertainty in V0 squared.

217
21:10,568 --> 21:12,548
And so now comes my big prediction.

218
21:13,088 --> 21:15,398
I'm going to make a prediction now.

219
21:16,498 --> 21:17,918
For 45 degrees,

220
21:22,398 --> 21:25,458
that OS equals

221
21:26,288 --> 21:27,698
V0 squared.

222
21:28,638 --> 21:29,918
We have that.

223
21:30,158 --> 21:31,388
That is 60.2.

224
21:33,058 --> 21:39,508
And we have the sign of two alpha is 1, and we divide by 9.8.

225
21:39,928 --> 21:42,378
That is 6.14 m.

226
21:46,288 --> 21:56,288
With an uncertainty of 5%, right? Because that's the uncertainty in V0 squared. And so that is an uncertainty of 30 cm, actually 31 cm.

227
21:57,268 --> 21:58,948
This is my prediction.

228
22:01,578 --> 22:04,488
For an angle of 45 degrees.

229
22:06,018 --> 22:12,218
This will only hold if there is no air drag or if the air drag is negligible.

230
22:12,918 --> 22:24,818
And of course, equally important that that spring gun, when the ball comes out, that the the velocity square is indeed within the range that we have assumed.

231
22:25,358 --> 22:31,908
And that it doesn't have bad days and good days. There's no way I I can check that anymore.

232
22:32,878 --> 22:33,658
All right.

233
22:34,688 --> 22:38,678
So we're going to mark the point 614.

234
22:39,008 --> 22:43,888
This is 1 m, 2 m, 3 m, 4 m, 5 m, 6 m.

235
22:44,418 --> 22:45,848
6.14.

236
22:47,708 --> 22:48,928
14.

237
22:50,808 --> 22:51,858
14 cm.

238
22:52,238 --> 22:54,238
Oh my god, it's all the way here.

239
22:55,058 --> 23:01,988
And then I allow for an error of about 30 cm. Did I do that right? That is correct.

240
23:03,188 --> 23:06,618
45 degrees, a 30 cm uncertainty.

241
23:07,338 --> 23:09,218
That is all the way up to here.

242
23:11,218 --> 23:18,678
And then the next one roughly 30 cm.

243
23:19,498 --> 23:25,618
So that's where if our calculations make sense, that's where the ball should hit.

244
23:26,808 --> 23:31,608
Now I would like you to come here if you don't mind and stand here.

245
23:32,518 --> 23:34,558
And the moment that that ball hits,

246
23:35,718 --> 23:36,898
point your finger at it.

247
23:37,368 --> 23:39,808
Don't do it before I shoot, but just after I shoot.

248
23:41,338 --> 23:42,988
And then we'll hope for the best.

249
23:43,988 --> 23:44,548
Yeah?

250
23:45,218 --> 23:45,718
Okay.

251
23:46,598 --> 23:47,868
You're not nervous, right?

252
23:49,628 --> 23:51,928
Where what happened with that ball that I had?

253
23:52,838 --> 23:53,998
Did I put it in my pocket?

254
23:56,658 --> 23:57,538
Oh, it's here.

255
23:58,328 --> 23:58,928
Thank you.

256
24:00,348 --> 24:03,738
So I'm going to set it now to the best I can at 45 degrees.

257
24:04,848 --> 24:05,168
Okay.

258
24:12,048 --> 24:13,948
So I can ever shoot it any further.

259
24:14,388 --> 24:19,308
This is the the angle which is the maximum possible distance.

260
24:20,658 --> 24:21,618
You ready?

261
24:22,888 --> 24:23,188
You are?

262
24:25,768 --> 24:28,548
Don't look at me, look there, it goes fast.

263
24:29,018 --> 24:31,708
Three, two, one, zero.

264
24:33,068 --> 24:34,398
Put your finger there.

265
24:37,288 --> 24:38,578
Isn't that fantastic?

266
24:39,708 --> 24:40,808
Isn't that amazing?

267
24:41,328 --> 24:45,288
Do you see now how important it is that you have uncertainties in your measurement?

268
24:46,028 --> 24:47,918
In high school you would have said it has to hit there.

269
24:48,448 --> 24:50,938
Boom man. It has an error.

270
24:51,568 --> 24:53,588
And the error has to be taken into account.

271
24:53,868 --> 24:55,168
Where's my ball by the way?

272
24:57,818 --> 24:58,398
Boy.

273
25:00,138 --> 25:01,788
Oh, I have it Oh, here.

274
25:04,708 --> 25:05,388
Okay.

275
25:06,038 --> 25:07,628
You can sit down now. You did great.

276
25:07,628 --> 25:09,178
It worked just because you were there.

277
25:14,828 --> 25:22,738
So now, I wonder what happens if I fire the ball at at 30 degrees.

278
25:23,988 --> 25:35,658
Well, if I do it at 30 degrees, then my V0 square is the same. I don't have to worry about that, I hope.

279
25:36,268 --> 25:42,338
However, I cannot be certain about the angle to better than one degree.

280
25:43,568 --> 25:47,698
So you will say, well, come on now. Don't be decadent.

281
25:48,158 --> 25:56,128
I mean, here we had an error of only 0.06% because of this one degree possible one degree offset.

282
25:56,428 --> 25:58,208
Let's just ignore this error too.

283
25:59,758 --> 26:02,348
Oh, that is risky.

284
26:03,268 --> 26:04,718
That is risky now.

285
26:05,508 --> 26:08,528
Because the sign of 60 degrees, that's what you deal with.

286
26:09,158 --> 26:14,518
The sign of 60 degrees, I think is 0.866.

287
26:15,048 --> 26:16,078
That's right.

288
26:19,298 --> 26:28,928
But the sign of 58 degrees, which is possible if I'm 1 degree under, is 0.848.

289
26:31,818 --> 26:34,778
And that is substantially lower.

290
26:36,058 --> 26:48,158
And therefore, I must allow for an uncertainty in the sign of the angle by roughly, oh, maybe something like 17 or 18 units.

291
26:48,158 --> 26:54,318
0. What is this difference? 0. 0 18.

292
26:55,008 --> 27:03,018
If you want to check what the sign of 62 degrees is, you will see that that is about this much higher than this.

293
27:04,268 --> 27:15,538
So we must allow for this error. And that is an error which is by no means negligible anymore. There's no point here.

294
27:16,848 --> 27:22,558
That is an error which is 18 divided by 866. That is a 2% error.

295
27:23,788 --> 27:30,058
So now we're dealing all of a sudden with a 2% error in the sign of 2 alpha,

296
27:30,398 --> 27:34,078
even though there's only a 1 degree uncertainty in the angle.

297
27:34,488 --> 27:37,648
And the reason is that this sign curve is like so.

298
27:38,288 --> 27:41,078
So a small angle change here makes no difference.

299
27:41,558 --> 27:44,268
But a small angle change here makes a lot of difference.

300
27:44,268 --> 27:44,998
And that's the reason.

301
27:45,328 --> 27:53,908
And you can see that it is the slope of the sign curve that gives you a much larger error if you are off by a teeny weeny little bit.

302
27:54,778 --> 27:57,158
So now we are ready to make a prediction.

303
27:57,778 --> 27:58,948
So here comes the prediction.

304
28:03,368 --> 28:07,288
OS now for 30 degrees.

305
28:09,868 --> 28:18,178
So I have to go through V0 squared, I have that, 60.2.

306
28:19,678 --> 28:29,558
And then I have to multiply by the sign of two alpha, that is the sign of 60 multiply.

307
28:30,658 --> 28:33,818
And then I think I have to divide by G, that is right.

308
28:34,198 --> 28:35,698
9.8.

309
28:36,308 --> 28:42,698
And I find 5.31 plus or minus. Now,

310
28:43,878 --> 28:46,898
2% error in the sign of 2 alpha.

311
28:47,488 --> 28:49,618
5% error in V0 squared.

312
28:49,938 --> 28:53,998
That gives me, I can't help it, a 7% error.

313
28:54,558 --> 28:58,668
So I have a 7% uncertainty multiplied by 0.07.

314
28:58,888 --> 29:03,948
So I cannot trust this any better than 37 cm.

315
29:05,508 --> 29:11,758
And so now I'm going to put the markers out at 5 m and 31 cm.

316
29:12,798 --> 29:14,638
This is the 5 meter mark.

317
29:15,858 --> 29:17,258
31 cm.

318
29:18,508 --> 29:21,858
And I allow for 37 cm on either side.

319
29:22,838 --> 29:23,698
That's here.

320
29:25,018 --> 29:29,868
And 37 cm on this side, that is here.

321
29:31,768 --> 29:33,818
Going to set the angle at 30 degrees.

322
29:36,948 --> 29:38,988
Yeah, yeah, where come you in?

323
29:39,618 --> 29:40,978
We need woman power here.

324
29:42,828 --> 29:43,598
Stay here.

325
29:44,568 --> 29:46,058
Stay out of the fire line.

326
29:47,078 --> 29:49,608
And when that ball hits, you jump on it.

327
29:49,968 --> 29:50,918
Yeah, you jump on it.

328
29:52,178 --> 29:54,368
Okay, everything under control.

329
29:55,118 --> 29:58,178
Five Make sure I marked it right. 5 meters 31.

330
29:58,178 --> 29:59,498
That looks about okay.

331
29:59,998 --> 30:03,128
And now I have to change the angle to 30 degrees.

332
30:11,008 --> 30:14,078
Okay, this is close as I can do it.

333
30:16,658 --> 30:17,418
Okay.

334
30:18,058 --> 30:18,738
You ready?

335
30:19,738 --> 30:20,378
You are?

336
30:21,048 --> 30:24,308
Three, two, one, zero.

337
30:25,358 --> 30:27,868
Hit the jackpot.

338
30:36,108 --> 30:38,878
Incredible.

339
30:39,558 --> 30:44,168
What you can argue now and successfully.

340
30:44,748 --> 30:48,918
You could say perhaps you have been a little bit too conservative on your errors.

341
30:48,918 --> 30:49,878
And I admit that.

342
30:50,548 --> 30:58,778
But believe me, when I did this morning, this five, six times, that the error in V zero was quite substantial. The high differences were sometimes 15 cm.

343
30:59,258 --> 31:04,288
And so I had no choice, but it looked like we were a bit on the conservative side.

344
31:04,928 --> 31:09,218
Suppose now I repeated this experiment at 60 degrees.

345
31:10,818 --> 31:11,848
What will change?

346
31:16,658 --> 31:18,568
What will change?

347
31:19,028 --> 31:20,588
Will OS change?

348
31:21,798 --> 31:28,038
No, because the sign of 120 degrees is the same as the sign of 60 degrees.

349
31:28,648 --> 31:34,408
You have two alpha here, the sign of 60 is the same as the sign of 120.

350
31:36,618 --> 31:45,788
If you allow for an uncertainty of 1 degree on either side, you will find exactly these same numbers because of the symmetry of the sign curve.

351
31:46,118 --> 31:48,538
So again, you're off by 2%.

352
31:48,948 --> 31:49,948
No difference.

353
31:50,368 --> 31:52,648
And so this prediction is unchanged.

354
31:53,658 --> 31:59,928
However, I want to ask you one question to see whether you are half alert or half asleep.

355
32:01,848 --> 32:05,598
At 30 degrees, you saw this.

356
32:06,258 --> 32:11,918
At 60 degrees, giving it the same initial speed, you will see this.

357
32:14,058 --> 32:18,858
It will have to hit here within the uncertainty of our measurements at the same location.

358
32:19,268 --> 32:22,038
It will of course go much higher.

359
32:22,488 --> 32:27,408
You can calculate that because you will have to use this for the equation for the height.

360
32:28,288 --> 32:30,778
And that goes with the sign of alpha.

361
32:31,178 --> 32:34,678
The sign of alpha for 60 degrees is way higher than 30 degrees.

362
32:35,738 --> 32:44,378
But now comes the question, will this trajectory take longer than this one or will they take the same amount of time?

363
32:45,938 --> 32:47,588
Who is for the same amount of time?

364
32:49,858 --> 32:50,968
Who is for longer?

365
32:52,868 --> 32:53,848
Who is for shorter?

366
32:55,648 --> 32:56,098
Okay.

367
32:57,458 --> 33:02,588
I'm happy with one set of fingers and unhappy with another set of fingers.

368
33:04,878 --> 33:10,718
What is the horizontal velocity of the golf ball when it takes off?

369
33:11,888 --> 33:22,488
If the velocity is the same in both cases, can't you see that this horizontal component is way larger than this horizontal component?

370
33:23,458 --> 33:28,138
And if they travel the same distance, then this trip must take longer.

371
33:29,358 --> 33:38,128
Because it's the horizontal component in the X direction, that determines how long it will take to go from here to there.

372
33:38,608 --> 33:42,988
Suppose I shot it straight up, how long do you think it will take to hit here?

373
33:45,728 --> 33:47,638
It has no horizontal component.

374
33:48,378 --> 33:55,628
All right? So, think about this. This trajectory will take longer, but it ends up at the same point.

375
33:56,878 --> 34:00,788
All right, number three, would you come here?

376
34:01,438 --> 34:03,488
So I don't have to change these markers.

377
34:03,938 --> 34:04,778
They're all perfect.

378
34:06,088 --> 34:09,418
Provided that nature is willing to reproduce itself.

379
34:10,658 --> 34:11,838
60 degrees.

380
34:19,118 --> 34:24,168
So we'll go way higher, but if all goes well, it should hit

381
34:26,068 --> 34:27,198
within the same marks. Ready?

382
34:28,688 --> 34:31,708
Three, two, one, zero.

383
34:34,548 --> 34:36,978
Here, man. Yeah, here, right?

384
34:38,298 --> 34:40,248
Thank you very much. Wonderful. Look.

385
34:41,718 --> 34:44,518
Maybe my uncertainties were not so dumb.

386
34:44,818 --> 34:46,878
We were just lucky here with the jackpot.

387
34:47,398 --> 34:50,978
It's comfortably within the error, but close to this one.

388
34:51,308 --> 34:55,208
So I'm quite happy that I took the uncertainties the way I did.

389
34:55,808 --> 34:59,888
Can we recover the ball? Did someone see it take off? Oh yeah.

390
35:01,058 --> 35:15,498
All right. Now we will enter a different part of this lecture, which is actually a very a very sad part.

391
35:21,788 --> 35:26,598
You know that people in Africa shoot monkeys.

392
35:33,288 --> 35:36,128
There's a monkey here in a tree.

393
35:39,918 --> 35:41,728
Very happy.

394
35:45,888 --> 35:49,788
And here is a hunter

395
35:52,368 --> 35:54,118
who never took 801.

396
35:56,098 --> 36:00,738
And he has a a gun, which is a golf ball gun.

397
36:03,908 --> 36:08,318
And he aims that gun right at the monkey.

398
36:09,818 --> 36:13,238
He shoots it with a certain velocity, the golf ball.

399
36:14,138 --> 36:19,578
Let this be the speed, V zero.

400
36:20,568 --> 36:28,018
So the horizontal component, you're going to see that again and again, V0 cosine alpha.

401
36:28,858 --> 36:36,118
And the vertical component equals V0 sin alpha.

402
36:37,358 --> 36:45,998
Let this be my increasing value of Y, and this be my increasing value of X.

403
36:48,388 --> 36:56,478
This um golf ball, this this golf gun is really not first class, thank goodness.

404
36:57,158 --> 37:03,418
And so, when the hunter shoots this golf ball, this happens.

405
37:06,228 --> 37:08,998
And it ends up here at point P.

406
37:10,478 --> 37:14,238
Lucky monkey, so far.

407
37:16,308 --> 37:24,628
Now, it is very tragic but true that when the monkey sees the flesh of the gun, it lets go.

408
37:25,718 --> 37:27,508
Okay.

409
37:30,158 --> 37:37,588
And now comes the question, is the monkey safe or is this the last day of the monkey?

410
37:40,678 --> 37:43,658
I ask the following question.

411
37:44,818 --> 37:50,668
This would be the trajectory with no gravity.

412
37:51,298 --> 37:55,998
And this is the trajectory with gravity. We can both agree on that.

413
37:57,678 --> 38:07,408
At a certain moment T1, let us assume that the golf ball would have been here without gravity.

414
38:08,338 --> 38:11,178
Then I know exactly where it is with gravity.

415
38:11,928 --> 38:17,838
It must be exactly here because

416
38:18,158 --> 38:24,478
the exposition XT1 is the same because the horizontal velocity is the same.

417
38:25,078 --> 38:31,878
That's independent of whether there is gravity or not. There is no acceleration in the X direction.

418
38:32,778 --> 38:36,618
And so, they are both exactly at the same exposition.

419
38:39,288 --> 38:41,788
What is this difference?

420
38:42,418 --> 38:46,828
Well, that is the difference between the equation with gravity and without gravity.

421
38:48,028 --> 39:09,818
And Y as a function of time, you can look at equation number three there if you can still see it, equals V0 Y which is V0 sin alpha times t minus 12 GT squared.

422
39:13,718 --> 39:18,408
Well, if there is no gravity, this term doesn't exist.

423
39:19,498 --> 39:22,768
So that's this straight line.

424
39:24,178 --> 39:27,728
With gravity, it's the same thing, but you have to subtract this.

425
39:28,708 --> 39:39,518
Therefore, this distance is 12 G T1 square. That is this distance, because this curve is lower by this amount.

426
39:41,698 --> 39:46,528
Now comes the time that the golf ball hits point P.

427
39:46,958 --> 40:03,838
When its position is XT2, the time here is T2, that means if there had been no gravity, the golf ball would have been there. They must have the same position in X at this catastrophic moment.

428
40:05,348 --> 40:16,868
So what now is the distance between the monkey and the golf ball, the distance between the two trajectories, one trajectory, no gravity, the other with gravity.

429
40:17,128 --> 40:22,468
This distance equals 1/2 G T2 squared.

430
40:22,818 --> 40:24,168
For that same reason.

431
40:25,668 --> 40:41,258
And we all know that if the monkey at time T equals zero let go that in T2 seconds, it will have fallen exactly over a distance 1/2 G T2 squared.

432
40:41,818 --> 40:44,818
Exactly. This couldn't be more tragic.

433
40:45,898 --> 40:47,908
And he will be killed.

434
40:50,128 --> 41:01,928
You may say, well, yeah, but you have manipulated the speed of that gun just so nicely. Oh, no. Oh, no.

435
41:02,688 --> 41:12,268
I can shoot that with a higher speed at the same angle alpha, and the trajectory would be this, and the monkey would be killed there.

436
41:13,828 --> 41:19,788
I can do it with a lower speed, and the monkey would be killed here.

437
41:20,048 --> 41:22,698
It's independent of the speed of the bullet.

438
41:23,408 --> 41:30,898
Because always this part here is always exactly the distance that the monkey falls in that time.

439
41:31,778 --> 41:40,178
However, if the speed is very low, that it hits the ground before the monkey hits the ground, well, okay, then the monkey is safe.

440
41:40,888 --> 41:44,618
So the only thing that is very, very critical is alpha.

441
41:45,248 --> 41:48,818
It must be precisely aimed at the monkey.

442
41:49,408 --> 41:54,628
If that's not the case, then the monkey will be safe.

443
41:55,998 --> 42:01,968
Now before we will witness this classic and rather tragic drama,

444
42:01,968 --> 42:07,598
I want to look at this from a somewhat different point of view, namely from the point of view of the monkey.

445
42:08,028 --> 42:14,468
The monkey sits there, looks at the gun, and the golf ball comes to the monkey.

446
42:14,948 --> 42:24,258
And I will put them both in a room, which is an elevator, and the elevator is in free fall, and they don't even know that.

447
42:25,218 --> 42:28,788
They both fall with the acceleration G.

448
42:30,488 --> 42:33,918
Here is the monkey tree.

449
42:35,948 --> 42:37,538
And here is the gun.

450
42:41,978 --> 42:49,498
The velocity of that bullet is V zero.

451
42:51,338 --> 42:56,728
And so the monkey will see that bullet comes straight at him.

452
42:57,128 --> 42:58,798
There's no such thing as an arc.

453
42:59,578 --> 43:06,938
They both fall in this falling in this falling elevator, and so the bullet comes

454
43:07,608 --> 43:11,758
The monkey happens to be a very intelligent monkey.

455
43:12,368 --> 43:16,218
And the monkey says to himself, how long do I have to live?

456
43:17,478 --> 43:20,258
And the monkey makes the following calculation.

457
43:23,018 --> 43:24,328
If this distance is D,

458
43:25,278 --> 43:27,098
and this is H,

459
43:27,498 --> 43:33,778
then the monkey says, aha, this is the square root of D squared plus h squared.

460
43:34,468 --> 43:48,778
So from the monkey point of view, the time for the kill will be the square root of D squared plus h squared divided by V zero.

461
43:49,118 --> 43:51,538
That's how many seconds he has to live.

462
43:53,118 --> 43:55,318
But you people are also quite smart.

463
43:56,068 --> 43:57,718
And you look at this diagram.

464
43:58,508 --> 44:01,878
And you said, no, no way.

465
44:02,588 --> 44:04,258
If this distance is D,

466
44:05,378 --> 44:11,928
then the speed to reach this point is V0 cosine alpha.

467
44:12,718 --> 44:25,508
In other words, the time that it takes for this object to reach this value of X. So for 26100 MIT students, T kill

468
44:26,218 --> 44:33,688
equals D divided by V0 cosine alpha.

469
44:34,588 --> 44:36,828
But what is the cosine of alpha?

470
44:37,828 --> 44:45,848
That is D divided by the square root of D squared plus h squared.

471
44:46,378 --> 44:51,898
So I can replace this cosine alpha by D divided by the square root.

472
44:52,368 --> 45:01,138
So I can replace this cosine alpha by D divided by the square root.

473
45:01,908 --> 45:09,198
And you and the monkey agree exactly on the amount of time that the monkey has to live.

474
45:09,198 --> 45:10,458
It better be that way.

475
45:10,968 --> 45:14,998
Because this could not depend on which reference frame you work in.

476
45:15,368 --> 45:19,428
The falling reference frame or for that matter,

477
45:20,168 --> 45:23,088
the reference frame of 26100.

478
45:24,588 --> 45:31,028
The monkey will be placed at about 3 meters above the table.

479
45:31,528 --> 45:37,758
We all know that it takes about 0.8 seconds. We've done many experiments at 3 meters, takes about 0.8 seconds.

480
45:37,998 --> 45:43,808
So the whole thing will go very fast. We were going to put the monkey up there.

481
45:45,218 --> 45:56,768
I want you to first see the trajectory of that golf ball before we bring the monkey, I mean, it is already so painful for this monkey. You don't want him to pre-experience what's going to happen.

482
45:57,668 --> 46:09,068
So, we will do this in the absence of the monkey, and we will let you, I will let you see

483
46:10,598 --> 46:12,188
what roughly

484
46:12,188 --> 46:13,778
the trajectory

485
46:13,778 --> 46:15,538
of that bullet will be.

486
46:15,538 --> 46:16,038
Okay.

487
46:16,038 --> 46:17,358
Three, two, one, zero.

488
46:17,358 --> 46:18,088
Okay.

489
46:18,088 --> 46:19,888
So it will hit somewhere here.

490
46:21,018 --> 46:22,198
That's that point P.

491
46:22,728 --> 46:31,668
So when you're going to see the drama in action, this is where the monkey will reach when the two hit each other.

492
46:33,938 --> 46:41,498
Now, you can imagine that this is a very painful day for the monkey.

493
46:41,768 --> 46:43,938
And I'm going to get the monkey.

494
46:44,838 --> 46:55,588
He's behind here and I hope that you would pay some respect to Robert. His name is Robert. And it may take me a minute.

495
46:56,788 --> 46:58,188
Okay.

496
47:38,658 --> 47:40,028
Here he is.

497
47:40,368 --> 47:41,618
Here is Robert.

498
47:49,078 --> 47:50,808
I thought

499
47:57,148 --> 48:00,868
I thought it was appropriate to change for the occasion.

500
48:01,688 --> 48:08,938
I don't go on monkey hunts too often, but when I do it, I'd like to do it in style.

501
48:13,678 --> 48:18,288
Here is Robert, and we're going to put Robert up here.

502
48:19,688 --> 48:39,198
Robert has in his head a metal plate so that when we activate the electromagnet, that we can stick him on there.

503
48:40,008 --> 48:44,368
And when we take the current off, then Robert will fall.

504
48:45,578 --> 48:49,318
So this is the activation of the electromagnet.

505
48:50,628 --> 48:51,028
Okay.

506
48:51,358 --> 48:53,028
Okay.

507
48:55,808 --> 48:57,868
So here we go.

508
48:58,328 --> 49:03,088
I can see Robert is nervous and you can't blame him.

509
49:03,408 --> 49:06,508
This is not the greatest day of his life.

510
49:07,948 --> 49:10,368
Oh, by the way, I want you to know.

511
49:10,738 --> 49:12,748
I mean, we are not cruel here.

512
49:13,248 --> 49:15,248
He's wearing a bulletproof vest.

513
49:19,898 --> 49:20,598
Oh boy.

514
49:21,178 --> 49:24,378
I can I can feel he's shaking all over his body.

515
49:24,768 --> 49:27,088
He's very nervous.

516
49:27,768 --> 49:29,948
Robert, don't let go yet.

517
49:31,478 --> 49:32,078
Oh.

518
49:32,228 --> 49:43,008
Let me show you, it's important that you know that we have done everything we can to aim this gun as accurately as we can at Robert.

519
49:45,138 --> 49:47,018
Okay.

520
49:54,418 --> 49:57,248
Robert, don't let go yet.

521
49:58,128 --> 50:02,098
We're going to first cock the gun. Hold it now. Hold it, Robert.

522
50:06,368 --> 50:08,528
This happens always with Robert.

523
50:17,058 --> 50:18,748
Okay.

524
50:28,038 --> 50:33,998
Okay, he just promised me that he will not let go again.

525
50:35,078 --> 50:36,008
Okay.

526
50:45,368 --> 51:05,568
When I cock the gun, if I can find the golf ball, it's here, then the electric circuit takes over, and now the current will be disconnected when the gun is fired.

527
51:09,908 --> 51:11,878
Even I even I'm nervous.

528
51:11,878 --> 51:13,908
I admit it, you know, this is a terrible thing to do.

529
51:17,248 --> 51:18,428
Terrible thing to do.

530
51:20,998 --> 51:21,708
You ready?

531
51:22,928 --> 51:25,328
Three, two, one, zero.

532
51:25,328 --> 51:27,528
Okay.

533
51:46,158 --> 51:47,878
Poor monkey.

534
51:52,768 --> 51:53,708
See you Friday.
