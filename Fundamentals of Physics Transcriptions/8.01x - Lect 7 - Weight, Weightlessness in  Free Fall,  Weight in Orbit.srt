00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:07,835
So far, in these lectures, we've talked about mass, about acceleration, and about forces,

2
00:00:08,365 --> 00:00:11,065
but we never used the word weight.

3
00:00:11,335 --> 00:00:18,705
And weight is a very non-intuitive and a very tricky thing, which is the entire subject of today's lecture.

4
00:00:19,565 --> 00:00:21,155
What is weight?

5
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:28,125
Here you stand on a bathroom scale.

6
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:34,855
Gravity is acting upon you. The force is mg.

7
00:00:35,585 --> 00:00:37,285
Your mass is M.

8
00:00:38,735 --> 00:00:42,565
The bathroom scale is pushing on you with a force F scale.

9
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:59,575
And that F scale, which in this case, if the system is not being accelerated, is the same as mg, that force from the bathroom scale on you, we define as weight.

10
00:01:00,325 --> 00:01:06,165
When I stand on the bathroom scale, I could see my weight is about 165 lbs.

11
00:01:06,495 --> 00:01:10,625
Now it may be calibrated in Newtons, but that's of course very unusual.

12
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:19,375
If I weigh myself on the moon where the gravitational acceleration is six times less, then I would weigh six times less.

13
00:01:20,565 --> 00:01:22,985
So far, so good.

14
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:26,265
Now, I'm going to put you in an elevator.

15
00:01:29,245 --> 00:01:37,675
And I'm going to accelerate you upwards and you're standing on your bathroom scale.

16
00:01:38,475 --> 00:01:44,375
Acceleration is in this direction. And I will call this plus, and I will call this minus.

17
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:54,475
Gravity is acting upon you, mg, and the bathroom scale is pushing on you with a force F.

18
00:01:55,835 --> 00:01:59,635
That force by definition is weight.

19
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:15,955
Before I write down some equations, I want you to realize that whenever, whenever you see in any of my equations G, G is always plus 9.8. And my signs, my minus signs take care of the directions,

20
00:02:16,315 --> 00:02:19,775
but G is always plus 9.8 or plus 10 if you prefer that.

21
00:02:20,825 --> 00:02:28,445
Okay, it's clear that if this is accelerated upwards, that f of S must be larger than mg, otherwise I cannot be accelerated.

22
00:02:28,805 --> 00:02:47,505
And so we get Newton's second law, F of S is in plus direction minus mg is in this direction equals M times A. And so the bathroom scale indicates M times A plus G.

23
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:50,415
And I have gained weight.

24
00:02:51,185 --> 00:03:01,015
If this acceleration is 5 meters per second square in this direction, I am one and a half times my normal weight.

25
00:03:01,455 --> 00:03:04,235
If I look on the bathroom scale, that's what I see.

26
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:08,275
Seeing is believing. That is my weight.

27
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:15,055
If I accelerate upwards with 30 meters per second squared, 30 plus 10 is 40.

28
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:24,445
I am four times my normal weight. Instead of my 160 5 lbs, I would weigh close to 700 lbs.

29
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:27,445
I see that. Seeing is believing.

30
00:03:27,785 --> 00:03:29,625
That is my weight.

31
00:03:30,705 --> 00:03:43,575
Now, I'm going to put you in the elevator. Here you are. And I'm going to accelerate you down. This is now A.

32
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:47,365
And just for my convenience, I call this now the plus direction.

33
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:50,295
Just for my convenience, it doesn't really matter.

34
00:03:50,865 --> 00:03:59,275
So now we have here mg, that is gravity acting upon you. And now you have the force from the bathroom scale.

35
00:04:00,515 --> 00:04:05,545
Clearly mg must be larger than FC, f of S, otherwise you couldn't go being accelerated downwards.

36
00:04:05,905 --> 00:04:16,015
So if now we write down Newton's second law, then we get mg minus f of S must be M times A.

37
00:04:16,395 --> 00:04:25,405
This holds for acceleration down, and so I get F of S equals M times g minus A.

38
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:31,475
This is one way of doing it, and you put in positive values for A.

39
00:04:31,845 --> 00:04:38,305
If A is 5 meters per second square, you get 10 minus 5 is 5. Your weight is half. You've lost weight.

40
00:04:39,165 --> 00:04:42,185
Being accelerated down, you've lost weight.

41
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:56,805
You could also have used this equation and not go through this trouble of setting up Newton's law again, you could simply have said, okay, this A is minus in this coordinate system. And so you put in a minus five and a plus 10, you get the same answer.

42
00:04:57,655 --> 00:05:01,695
So, you have lost weight when you accelerate downwards.

43
00:05:02,605 --> 00:05:06,405
Suppose now I cut the cable.

44
00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:08,165
I cut it.

45
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:13,565
Then this A is 10 meters per second square, if we round it off.

46
00:05:14,055 --> 00:05:16,175
You go down with 10 meters per second square.

47
00:05:16,485 --> 00:05:18,985
So g minus A is zero.

48
00:05:19,845 --> 00:05:22,565
You are now weightless.

49
00:05:23,225 --> 00:05:24,415
You're free falling.

50
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:31,495
You have no longer any weight. You look at the bathroom scale and the bathroom scale will indicate a zero.

51
00:05:32,385 --> 00:05:35,745
You're floating. Everything in the elevator is floating.

52
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:43,105
If you had a glass with water, you could turn it over, and the water would not fall out.

53
00:05:43,555 --> 00:05:50,515
It's like having the shuttle in orbit with the astronauts being weightless.

54
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:57,415
There is a great similarity between the astronauts in the shuttle and a free falling elevator.

55
00:05:57,705 --> 00:06:02,165
The only difference is that the elevator will crash, will kill you.

56
00:06:02,585 --> 00:06:14,245
In the case of the shuttle, it never hits the earth because of its high speed. We'll talk about this much later when we deal with orbits and with Kepler's law.

57
00:06:15,795 --> 00:06:18,925
What exactly is free fall?

58
00:06:19,465 --> 00:06:25,565
Free fall is when the forces acting upon you are exclusively gravitational.

59
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:36,055
Nothing is pushing on you, no seat is pushing on you, no string is pushing on you. Nothing is pulling on you. Only gravity.

60
00:06:36,945 --> 00:06:42,535
I will return to thislessness very shortly in great detail. But before I do that,

61
00:06:42,915 --> 00:06:51,585
I would like to address the issue, how could I determine your weight if I hang you from a string?

62
00:06:52,335 --> 00:06:56,415
So now, instead of standing on a bathroom scale,

63
00:06:57,465 --> 00:07:09,245
you are here. Here is a string. You might even have in the string a tension meter, as we have seen earlier in lectures, and you're holding desperately onto that string.

64
00:07:10,175 --> 00:07:11,415
Just like that.

65
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:27,665
System is not being accelerated. Gravity is mg. And so there must be a tension in this string T, which is pulling you up, which if there is no acceleration, must be mg.

66
00:07:28,575 --> 00:07:32,435
I read the scale and I read my weight.

67
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:37,575
This scale indicates in my case 165 pounds.

68
00:07:37,905 --> 00:07:40,595
While I'm hanging, I can see my weight.

69
00:07:41,465 --> 00:07:51,215
So you see, it makes very little difference whether I'm standing on a bathroom scale and read the force with which the bathroom scale pushes up on me,

70
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:57,935
or whether I hang from a scale, extend a spring and read that value.

71
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:02,455
It makes no difference. The tension here would indicate my weight.

72
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:13,105
There's a complete similarity with the bathroom scale, except in one case, something is pulling on me, in the other case, something is pushing on me from below.

73
00:08:14,255 --> 00:08:22,385
Now let's accelerate this system upwards with an acceleration A. And I call this plus.

74
00:08:23,345 --> 00:08:27,965
Then of course, this T must grow, otherwise you cannot be accelerated.

75
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:38,725
Newton's second law. T minus mg must be MA. The tension in the string equals M times A plus G.

76
00:08:39,115 --> 00:08:43,265
Ah, we've seen that before. No difference with the elevator.

77
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:47,265
You accelerate the system, the tension will increase, and you will see that.

78
00:08:47,535 --> 00:08:52,215
You will read that on the scale. Your weight has increased.

79
00:08:52,855 --> 00:08:53,855
You weigh more.

80
00:08:54,915 --> 00:09:01,245
Needless to say, of course, if you accelerate the system down, that you will weigh less. I just went through that argument.

81
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:07,105
And if I cut the cable completely, you go into free fall, T will go to zero.

82
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:17,105
A become minus 10 plus 10 is zero, you're in free fall, the scale reads zero, you are completely weightless.

83
00:09:18,665 --> 00:09:28,015
If we accept the idea of weight being indicated by the tension in a string,

84
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:32,525
then there is a very interesting consequence of that.

85
00:09:33,765 --> 00:09:45,615
I have here a pin which is completely frictionless. And I have on both sides a string, and this string has negligibly small mass. Let's just assume that it is massless.

86
00:09:46,165 --> 00:09:57,245
And there is here an object M1, and there is here an object M2, and I'm telling you that M2 is larger than M1.

87
00:09:57,845 --> 00:10:02,745
So we all know what's going to happen. This system is going to accelerate in this direction.

88
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:07,535
M2 will be accelerated down and M1 will be accelerated up.

89
00:10:09,435 --> 00:10:13,375
What comes now is important that you grasp that.

90
00:10:13,865 --> 00:10:21,125
I claim that the tension on the left side must be the same as the tension in this string on the right side.

91
00:10:21,715 --> 00:10:25,475
T left must be T right. Why is that?

92
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:32,835
It is because the pin is frictionless and it is because the string is massless.

93
00:10:33,815 --> 00:10:38,825
Take a little section of the string here, a tiny little section.

94
00:10:39,815 --> 00:10:45,095
If there is a tension on it, there is a force in this direction, and there is a force in this direction.

95
00:10:45,715 --> 00:10:50,775
These two could never be different because then this massless string would get an infinite acceleration.

96
00:10:51,575 --> 00:10:55,245
So there can never be a change in tension from this side of the string to the other.

97
00:10:55,745 --> 01:02,075
If you take a little section of the string here, there it is. Tey- weeny little section.

98
01:02,565 --> 01:06,255
So there is tension on the string, and there is tension on the string.

99
01:07,405 --> 01:12,115
This one could never be larger than that because this little piece of string would get an infinite acceleration.

100
01:12,335 --> 01:21,205
So, because there is no friction on the pin, and because the strings are massless, only because of that must the tension be everywhere the same.

101
01:21,645 --> 01:25,035
If there is friction in the pin, which we will do later, then it's not the case.

102
01:25,795 --> 01:30,815
Given the fact that the tension left and the tension right are the same,

103
01:31,085 --> 01:36,305
I must now conclude that these two objects have the same weight.

104
01:36,615 --> 01:40,665
Because didn't we agree that tension is an indication of weight.

105
01:41,335 --> 01:43,945
So these objects have now the same weight.

106
01:44,185 --> 01:50,355
And some people may say, 'Oh, that's a lot of nonsense. You must be kidding. If M2 is larger than M1, this must have a larger weight than that.'

107
01:50,605 --> 01:52,385
Well, they are confusing weight with mass.

108
01:52,775 --> 02:04,015
It is true that M2 is a larger mass than M1, but it's equally true that the weight of these two objects is now the same according to my definition of weight.

109
02:05,515 --> 02:10,465
Let us calculate the acceleration of this system and let's calculate the tension.

110
02:11,225 --> 02:12,595
And let's see what comes out.

111
02:13,185 --> 02:18,675
I first isolate here object number one. So this is my object number one.

112
02:19,315 --> 02:26,185
I have gravity M1G, and I have a tension T.

113
02:27,425 --> 02:34,025
Non-negotiable. T be better larger than M1G, otherwise it would never be accelerated up. And we know it will be accelerated up.

114
02:34,975 --> 02:39,545
So what do we get? We get T, I will call this plus direction by the way.

115
02:40,695 --> 02:45,525
minus M1G equals M times A.

116
02:46,425 --> 02:52,895
So the tension equals M1 * A + G.

117
02:53,855 --> 02:55,175
Hey, we've seen that one before.

118
02:55,795 --> 03:00,445
This one is being accelerated upwards. Notice, it gains weight.

119
03:01,815 --> 03:06,735
That's the tension. And this is the acceleration. I have one equation with two unknowns.

120
03:07,695 --> 03:09,365
So I can't solve it yet.

121
03:10,525 --> 03:14,035
But there is another one. There is number two here.

122
03:14,825 --> 03:22,025
For number two, we have a force M2G, and we have the tension up.

123
03:22,435 --> 03:26,695
This one better be larger than that one, otherwise it wouldn't be accelerated down.

124
03:27,535 --> 03:30,115
Let me call this direction plus.

125
03:30,795 --> 03:36,385
The reason why I now switch directions and call this plus as well as this is a good reason for it.

126
03:36,695 --> 03:38,575
It's not so arbitrary anymore.

127
03:38,855 --> 03:44,615
I know that this acceleration is going to be a positive number because it's going in this direction, it's a given.

128
03:45,655 --> 03:52,265
If I called this negative, I would get here a negative acceleration for the same thing for which I get here a positive.

129
03:52,555 --> 03:57,595
That's a pain in the neck. I don't want to have a plus and a minus sign there. Have to think about that it means the same thing.

130
03:57,875 --> 04:06,215
So the the moment that I defined define this the plus direction, I know that this acceleration will also come out to be the same sign as this one.

131
04:06,525 --> 04:07,755
So I flip the signs there.

132
04:08,485 --> 04:10,465
So now I apply Newton's law.

133
04:11,115 --> 04:17,155
I get M2G minus T equals M2A.

134
04:17,865 --> 04:28,245
And so I get T, I'll write it here equals M2 times g minus A.

135
04:30,735 --> 04:34,725
Two equations with two unknowns.

136
04:36,735 --> 04:40,245
Well, that shouldn't be so hard to solve these two equations.

137
04:40,745 --> 04:49,055
You can immediately eliminate T by the way, if you add this one with this one, you're ready, I call this equation one, and you call this equation two,

138
04:49,755 --> 05:03,205
you immediately lose your T and you get that the acceleration A equals M2 - M1 divided by M1 + M2 times G.

139
05:04,865 --> 05:16,275
And you substitute that A in that equation, and you find that the tension equals 2mg divided by M1 + M2.

140
05:17,005 --> 05:19,675
This is very easy for you to verify.

141
05:21,275 --> 05:24,655
Let us look, this is M1 M2.

142
05:27,405 --> 05:32,685
2M1 M2, I lost one M, 2M1 M2.

143
05:33,155 --> 05:36,545
Let's look at these equations. Let's scrutinize them a little. Let's get some feeling for it.

144
05:37,185 --> 05:40,595
Rather than accepting them as being dumb equations.

145
05:41,345 --> 05:47,585
Let's first take the case that M2 equals M1, and I'll call that M.

146
05:48,665 --> 06:00,015
Notice that A becomes zero, and notice if you substitute for M1 and M2 M here, that you get 2m, you get mg.

147
06:00,655 --> 06:02,895
So T becomes mg.

148
06:03,555 --> 06:05,165
That is utterly obvious.

149
06:05,585 --> 06:12,125
If M1 and M2 are the same, nothing is going to happen. They're going to sit there. The acceleration will be zero.

150
06:12,515 --> 06:17,405
And the tension on both sides, which is always the same, we argue that, is going to be mg.

151
06:17,925 --> 06:18,905
Clear.

152
06:19,685 --> 06:21,895
Now, we're going to make it more interesting.

153
06:22,515 --> 06:31,645
Suppose we make M2 much, much larger than M1, and in a limiting case, we even go with M1 to zero.

154
06:32,605 --> 06:33,725
Let's do that.

155
06:34,475 --> 06:44,045
What you see now, if M1 goes to zero, this this goes away. This goes away. A goes to G.

156
06:44,985 --> 06:51,645
And T goes to zero. If M1 is zero, T goes to zero.

157
06:52,415 --> 06:54,275
That is obvious.

158
06:54,805 --> 07:01,005
Because if I make M1 zero, M2 goes into free fall.

159
07:01,405 --> 07:13,005
And if M2 goes into free fall, its weight is zero. And so the tension is zero. And it's exactly what you see. And you see that the acceleration of that object is G, which it better be because it's in free fall.

160
07:13,675 --> 07:18,375
So you see, this makes sense. This is exactly consistent with your intuition.

161
07:19,105 --> 07:32,385
And if you wanted to make M1 much, much larger than M2, and you take the limiting case for M 2 goes to zero, you'll find again that A goes to Z, G, and that T goes to zero.

162
07:33,075 --> 07:44,075
Except that now the acceleration is not this way, but now the acceleration is this way. And now this object will go into free fall.

163
07:44,815 --> 07:48,915
And therefore, there is no tension in the string anymore.

164
07:52,865 --> 07:58,285
M1, if I return to the case which we have there, that M2 is larger than M1,

165
07:58,675 --> 08:03,575
M1 is being accelerated upwards. That's non-negotiable. So it must have gained weight.

166
08:04,725 --> 08:09,055
M2 is being accelerated down, so it must have lost weight.

167
08:09,335 --> 08:11,705
Just like being in an elevator, there is no difference.

168
08:13,485 --> 08:15,065
They each way the same.

169
08:15,645 --> 08:20,425
One loses weight, the other gains weight. They each way the same.

170
08:21,145 --> 08:41,285
And so I can make the prediction that if this is M2G, which was its original weight, and this now is the new weight T, that M2G must be larger than T. M1 gains weight, so T must be larger than M1G. M2 loses weight, so T must be smaller than M2G.

171
08:41,915 --> 08:43,655
That's my prediction. It has to be.

172
08:44,445 --> 08:55,795
And we can, I can show you that with some easy numbers. Let M1 be 1.1 kg and let M2 be 1.25 kg.

173
08:57,305 --> 09:03,175
Frictionless system and the string has a negligible mass.

174
09:03,735 --> 09:14,215
What is the acceleration A of the system? I get M2 - M1, that is 0.15 divided by the sum, which is 2.35.

175
09:14,775 --> 09:19,215
And that is approximately 0.064G.

176
09:20,275 --> 09:26,545
approximately 0.064G. It's about 1/16th of the gravitational acceleration.

177
09:27,035 --> 09:30,265
So it's a very modest acceleration.

178
09:30,925 --> 09:45,225
What is the tension? Well, I substitute my numbers for M1 and M2 in there. You can take for G 10 if you like that. And you will find that the tension equals 1.17 G.

179
09:46,515 --> 09:49,315
And now look at what I predicted.

180
09:50,015 --> 09:53,425
They both weigh 1.17 G. That's non-negotiable.

181
09:53,905 --> 09:58,555
That is my definition of weight. The tension in both sides is the same, that's my definition of weight.

182
09:59,445 --> 10:01,095
This is their weight.

183
10:01,915 --> 10:08,895
This one had a weight 1.25 G without being accelerated.

184
10:09,345 --> 10:12,735
You see, it has lost weight, because it accelerated down.

185
10:13,475 --> 10:16,845
This one had a weight of 1.1 G.

186
10:17,475 --> 10:20,595
You see, it has gained weight because it's accelerated up.

187
10:21,135 --> 10:27,715
So you see the whole picture ties together very neatly and it's important that you look at it that way.

188
10:28,785 --> 10:34,595
I now want to return to the idea of complete weightlessness.

189
10:35,275 --> 10:41,935
And I want to remind you, a few lectures ago, how I was swinging you at the end of a string in the vertical.

190
10:42,375 --> 10:43,585
I was swinging you like this.

191
10:44,285 --> 10:47,445
And I was swinging a bucket of water like this.

192
10:47,875 --> 10:49,625
And I want to return to that.

193
10:50,995 --> 11:01,675
I want to look at you when you are at the bottom of your circle and when you are at the very top of that circle.

194
11:04,755 --> 11:09,325
You go around a circle which has radius R.

195
11:09,975 --> 11:11,495
Here is that circle.

196
11:14,875 --> 11:16,225
Okay.

197
11:17,035 --> 11:24,275
There's a string here, you're here, and there's a string here. And at some point in time, you're there and you're going around.

198
11:24,605 --> 11:31,555
Let's assume that you're going around with an angular velocity omega, and for simplicity, we keep omega constant.

199
11:32,165 --> 11:33,645
But that's really not that important.

200
11:34,635 --> 11:36,355
Okay, this is point P.

201
11:37,565 --> 11:39,035
And this is point S.

202
11:39,655 --> 11:43,755
Let's first look at the situation at point P.

203
11:44,805 --> 11:49,355
You have a mass and so gravity acts upon you, mg.

204
11:50,245 --> 11:53,605
There is tension in the string, T.

205
11:54,785 --> 12:02,075
There must be, this is non-negotiable, a centripetal acceleration upwards, otherwise you could never do this.

206
12:02,415 --> 12:04,345
Remember from the uniform circular motion.

207
12:04,825 --> 12:18,945
So there must be here a centripetal acceleration, which is omega square R or if you prefer V squared divided by R, if V is the speed, tangential speed at that point.

208
12:19,765 --> 12:20,825
It must be there.

209
12:22,375 --> 12:23,875
Let's look here.

210
12:25,155 --> 12:30,415
Right there, gravity is acting upon you. Mg.

211
12:32,415 --> 12:35,585
Let's assume the string is pulling on you. Let's assume that for now.

212
12:36,315 --> 12:38,375
So there is tension.

213
12:38,935 --> 12:40,945
String is pulling on you.

214
12:42,225 --> 12:53,885
Therefore, non-negotiable, when you make this curvature here, there must be a centripetal acceleration, and that centripetal acceleration must be omega square R.

215
12:54,225 --> 12:55,935
That is non-negotiable.

216
12:56,225 --> 12:57,415
It has to be there.

217
12:57,875 --> 13:02,235
Let's now evaluate first the situation at P.

218
13:03,305 --> 13:07,435
And I will call this plus, and I'll call this minus.

219
13:08,665 --> 13:19,225
So what I get now is that T minus mg must be M times the centripetal acceleration.

220
13:19,835 --> 13:24,855
So T must be M times the centripetal acceleration plus G.

221
13:25,475 --> 13:33,885
Hey, that looks very familiar. It looks like someone is being someone is being accelerated in an elevator, almost the same equation.

222
13:35,925 --> 13:47,535
If the centripetal acceleration at this point, for instance, were 10 meters per second squared, then you would weigh twice your normal weight.

223
13:48,205 --> 13:52,815
The tension here would be twice mg.

224
13:54,275 --> 14:01,505
If this were 5 meters per second squared, then you would be one and a half times you weight.

225
14:02,645 --> 14:07,105
Let's now look at the situation at S.

226
14:08,565 --> 14:16,285
At point S, I'm going to call this plus and that minus.

227
14:18,455 --> 14:28,245
I'm going to find that T plus mg must be M times the centripetal acceleration. Newton's second law.

228
14:28,815 --> 14:35,345
So I find that the tension there equals n times A of C minus G.

229
14:36,315 --> 14:40,065
Hey, very similar to what I've seen before.

230
14:40,795 --> 14:43,625
This object is losing weight.

231
14:46,515 --> 14:55,335
Let us take the situation that A of C is exactly 10 m per second squared. And we discussed that last time when we had the bucket of water in our hands.

232
14:55,695 --> 15:02,965
If A of C, if the centripetal acceleration when it make when it goes through the top is 10, then this is zero.

233
15:03,555 --> 15:11,455
So the string has no tension. The string goes limp, and the bucket of water and you are weightless.

234
15:12,615 --> 15:25,895
If the centripetal acceleration is larger than 10, then, of course, the string will be tight. There will be a force on you, and whatever comes out of here will indicate your weight.

235
15:26,885 --> 15:33,075
If A of C is smaller than 10, that's meaningless.

236
15:33,605 --> 15:39,555
The tension can never be negative. A string with negative tension has no physical meaning.

237
15:39,855 --> 15:44,175
What it means is that the bucket of water would never have made it to this point.

238
15:44,535 --> 15:54,535
If you try to swing it up, as someone tried in the second lecture, but didn't make it to that point, the bucket of water will just fall. And you end up with a mess, but that's a detail.

239
15:56,115 --> 16:10,845
So, the bucket of water, when it is here, if the acceleration there, the centripetal acceleration were exactly 10 meters per second squared, then that bucket of water would be weightless.

240
16:12,675 --> 16:17,905
So, I said earlier that when you're in free fall, all objects in free fall are weightless.

241
16:18,925 --> 16:23,835
It's like a spacecraft in orbit, or it is an elevator with a cut cable.

242
16:24,945 --> 16:34,305
It also means that if I jump off the table, that I'm weightless while I am in mid-air, so to speak.

243
16:34,655 --> 16:39,425
It means this tennis ball, while it is in free fall, it has no weight.

244
16:40,155 --> 16:47,075
Now it has weight. Now the weight is even higher because I'm accelerating it. And now it has no weight.

245
16:47,395 --> 16:53,295
The tennis ball is weightless. And I assume for now that the air drag plays no role.

246
16:55,555 --> 17:02,075
If I jump off the table, I will be weightless for about half a second.

247
17:02,565 --> 17:03,885
This is about 1 meter.

248
17:04,325 --> 17:11,575
If I jump from a tower which is 100 meters high, I will be weightless for four and a half seconds, ignoring air drag.

249
17:12,235 --> 17:16,535
I prefer today the half a second.

250
17:18,555 --> 17:23,535
I'm going to jump off this table with this water in my hand.

251
17:25,465 --> 17:32,735
And I'm going to tell you how I can convince you that as I jumped, that I will indeed be weightless.

252
17:33,765 --> 17:35,085
Here is the bottle.

253
17:36,375 --> 17:39,445
There's a gravitational force on the bottle.

254
17:40,425 --> 17:43,665
My hands are pushing up on this bottle.

255
17:44,365 --> 17:46,995
My hands are being a bathroom scale.

256
17:47,315 --> 17:51,455
I feel in my muscles the need to push up.

257
17:51,775 --> 17:56,775
In fact, I might even be able to estimate the weight, playing the role of a bathroom scale.

258
17:57,265 --> 18:01,755
It's a gallon of water. That's about 9 lbs.

259
18:04,275 --> 18:09,095
Now my own body, gravity is acting upon me, but I'm being pushed up right there.

260
18:11,545 --> 18:17,375
Suppose we jumped.

261
18:18,435 --> 18:22,335
There would be no pushing from me on the bottle anymore.

262
18:22,585 --> 18:30,595
No pushing there on me at the table. Only gravitation would act upon us and we would be weightless.

263
18:31,125 --> 18:33,415
How can I show you that we are weightless?

264
18:33,755 --> 18:42,125
Well, if I don't have to use my muscles to push on this bottle upwards, I might as well lower my hands a little bit during this free fall.

265
18:42,845 --> 18:49,205
And you will see that the bottle will just stay above my hands without my having to push up.

266
18:49,465 --> 18:58,345
Therefore, being the bathroom scale, I no longer have to push on it. I no longer my muscles don't feel anything, and the bottle is therefore weightless.

267
18:59,185 --> 19:07,305
The bottle is weightless when we jump. I am weightless and even this bagel is weightless. We're all weightless during half a second.

268
19:08,635 --> 19:12,485
There is no such thing in physics as a free lunch.

269
19:12,905 --> 19:17,505
You have to pay a price for this half a second of weightlessness.

270
19:18,245 --> 19:20,165
What happens when I hit the floor?

271
19:20,565 --> 19:26,485
I hit the floor with this velocity in this direction, which is about 5 meters per second. You can calculate that.

272
19:27,035 --> 19:29,495
But a little later, I've come to a stop.

273
19:29,955 --> 19:38,595
That means during the impact, there must be an acceleration upwards. Otherwise my velocity in this direction could never become zero.

274
19:39,335 --> 19:45,555
Therefore, I will weigh more during this impact. There is an acceleration in this direction.

275
19:46,165 --> 19:49,145
The 5 meters per second goes to zero.

276
19:49,725 --> 19:54,945
If I make the assumption that it takes two tens of a second, that's a very rough guess this impact time.

277
19:55,545 --> 20:02,415
Then the average acceleration will be 5 meters per second divided by 0.2, that is 25 meters per second squared.

278
20:02,915 --> 20:06,705
That means the acceleration upwards is 2 and a half G.

279
20:07,385 --> 20:11,375
That means I will weigh three and a half times more. Remember this A plus G.

280
20:11,745 --> 20:17,885
So A is 2 and a half G up, plus the G that we already have, that makes it three and a half G.

281
20:18,325 --> 20:24,265
So instead of weighing 165 pounds, I weigh close to 600 pounds for two tens of a second.

282
20:24,775 --> 20:30,225
So we get four phases. Right now, I'm my normal weight. If I stand on a bathroom scale.

283
20:30,725 --> 20:37,505
I jump for half a second, weightless. Hit the floor for about two tens of a second, maybe close to 600 pounds.

284
20:37,955 --> 20:41,235
And then after that, I will have my normal weight again.

285
20:41,965 --> 20:49,445
Now, you're going to have only half a second to see that this bottle, as I jump is floating above my hands.

286
20:49,705 --> 20:54,725
I will pull my hands off. So you will see that I no longer have to push it.

287
20:55,105 --> 20:57,565
That means it's weightless.

288
20:58,985 --> 21:01,055
If you're ready, I'm ready.

289
21:01,645 --> 21:04,405
3, two, one, zero.

290
21:05,935 --> 21:07,745
Did you see it floating above my hands?

291
21:08,075 --> 21:09,825
We were both weightless.

292
21:11,425 --> 21:16,975
Now, I have been thinking about this for a long, long time.

293
21:17,235 --> 21:27,465
I have been thinking whether perhaps this could not be shown in a more dramatic way, perhaps even a more convincing way.

294
21:27,815 --> 21:35,705
And so I thought of the idea of putting a bathroom scale under my feet, tying it very loosely so that it wouldn't fall off when I jump.

295
21:36,275 --> 21:43,745
And then show you that while I am half a second in free fall, that the bathroom scale indeed indicates zero.

296
21:44,655 --> 21:49,475
And don't think that I haven't tried it. I've tried it many times with many bathroom scales. I made many jumps.

297
21:49,995 --> 21:51,255
There is a problem.

298
21:51,715 --> 21:56,725
And the problem is the bathroom scales that you buy, that you normally get commercially,

299
21:57,475 --> 21:59,055
they indeed want to go to zero.

300
21:59,595 --> 22:04,535
It takes them a long time. They have a lot of inertia. Their response time is slow.

301
22:05,695 --> 22:09,035
But even if they make it to zero by the time you hit the floor,

302
22:09,555 --> 22:16,115
then immediately the weight increases because you hit the floor and your weight comes up by three and a half times.

303
22:16,405 --> 22:21,435
So it begins to swing back and forth and it becomes completely chaotic, and you can no longer see what's happening.

304
22:21,985 --> 22:28,005
And it just so happened that about six months ago, Dave, I had dinner with Professor Dave Trumper.

305
22:28,405 --> 22:32,275
And I explained it to him that it is just unfortunate that you can never really show it.

306
22:32,555 --> 22:39,225
that you jump off the table, have a bathroom scale under you, and see that weight go down to zero when you're in free fall.

307
22:39,555 --> 22:42,525
And he said, duck soup. I can do that.

308
22:42,945 --> 22:48,555
He says, I can make you a scale which has a response time of maybe 10 milliseconds.

309
22:49,435 --> 22:55,165
So, when you jump off the table, in 10 milliseconds, you will see that thing go down to zero.

310
22:55,725 --> 23:05,245
And he delivered. He came through. He built this wonderful device which he and I are going to demonstrate to you.

311
23:05,925 --> 23:11,645
Let me first give you some reasonable light for this.

312
23:14,225 --> 23:22,485
And I would like to show you on the scale there, what this scale that he built is indicating.

313
23:22,895 --> 23:24,055
Here is the scale.

314
23:25,435 --> 23:26,565
I have it in my hands.

315
23:27,115 --> 23:31,245
And on top of this scale is a little platform, just like on your scale.

316
23:31,725 --> 23:34,005
This platform weighs 4 and a half pounds.

317
23:34,675 --> 23:38,675
And you can see that. It's just about 4 and a half.

318
23:39,595 --> 23:43,415
Now you will say, hmm, I wouldn't want that kind of a bathroom scale.

319
23:43,795 --> 23:51,145
I mean, if I want to see my bathroom scale, I want to see a zero before I want to go up. I'm heavy enough all by myself. I don't want to get another four and a half pounds."

320
23:51,745 --> 23:55,425
The manufacturer has simply zeroed that scale for you.

321
23:55,795 --> 23:58,875
But obviously, also your bathroom scale has a cover on it.

322
23:59,695 --> 24:09,095
Once you have seen these demonstrations, you will be able to answer for yourself why we don't zero this, why we really leave this to be four and a half.

323
24:09,455 --> 24:18,415
That's the actual mass which is on top of the spring. Well, it's not really a spring. It is a pressure gauge, but think of it as a spring.

324
24:18,665 --> 24:19,935
4 and 1/2 pounds.

325
24:20,865 --> 24:27,705
Here, we have a a weight, which is a barbell weight, which is 10 lbs.

326
24:28,535 --> 24:29,135
Right.

327
24:30,445 --> 24:35,875
Is this from one of your children, Dave? Are you doing it yourself?

328
24:36,535 --> 24:37,415
10 lbs.

329
24:38,215 --> 24:40,175
We'll put it on top here.

330
24:41,405 --> 24:44,295
What do you see? Roughly 14 and 1/2 lbs.

331
24:45,495 --> 24:49,265
All right, we're going to tape it down.

332
24:49,265 --> 24:54,475
There we go.

333
24:55,375 --> 25:05,555
And we're going to drop it from about 1 and 1/2, 2 meters, and we drop it in here, well cushioned, because we don't want to break this beautiful device.

334
25:08,275 --> 25:15,185
When we drop it, the response is so fast that you will see indeed that pointer go to zero.

335
25:16,035 --> 25:21,585
Now keep in mind when it hits the cushioning, that the weight will go up.

336
25:22,475 --> 25:29,255
For now, I want you to concentrate only on the thing going to zero and not what comes later. We will deal with that within a minute.

337
25:30,865 --> 25:38,145
Okay. 14 and a half pounds.

338
25:40,675 --> 25:44,635
You know why the thing is actually jiggling back and forth? Because I can't hold it exactly still.

339
25:46,265 --> 25:52,075
And so I slightly accelerate it upwards and downwards. And when I accelerate it slightly upwards, it weighs a little more.

340
25:52,665 --> 25:55,205
And when I accelerate it downwards, it weighs less. It's interesting.

341
25:55,685 --> 25:57,445
You can see I'm nervous."

342
25:57,815 --> 25:59,665
Here, that's my nervous tension meter there.

343
26:00,305 --> 26:00,905
Okay.

344
26:01,555 --> 26:02,305
We're ready?

345
26:03,175 --> 26:04,515
Look at, don't look at me now.

346
26:04,865 --> 26:09,265
Look at that pointer. 3, 2, 1, 0.

347
26:10,685 --> 26:13,435
Did you see it go to zero? All the way to zero.

348
26:14,995 --> 26:18,635
Now comes something even more remarkable.

349
26:19,705 --> 26:21,225
He said to me,

350
26:21,935 --> 26:31,855
I can also make the students see the response on a time scale of about fraction of a second."

351
26:31,855 --> 26:37,455
By the way, this is the hero who made all this stuff. He's fantastic.

352
26:37,455 --> 26:38,635
Yeah.

353
26:42,845 --> 26:53,745
He can show you the weight on an electronic scale, and this weight you will see as a function of time.

354
26:55,905 --> 27:03,785
I'll put the 10 lbs back on again. Tape it a little tighter.

355
27:05,385 --> 27:10,635
And so the level that you see now is 14 and 1/2 lbs.

356
27:11,135 --> 27:14,525
This is 14 and 1/2 lbs, and this is zero. This mark is zero.

357
27:15,255 --> 27:16,255
Zero."

358
27:16,835 --> 27:20,935
I'm going to hold it in my hand.

359
27:24,795 --> 27:28,715
And notice, if I can hold it still, you're back to your 14 and 1/2 pounds.

360
27:29,985 --> 27:43,805
Now, I'm going to drop it. You will see it go down to zero. It will hit the floor, the cushion, it will get an acceleration upwards. It will become way heavier than it was before."

361
27:44,205 --> 27:48,485
And then it will even be bounce back up in the air. It goes again into free fall.

362
27:48,945 --> 27:55,595
We will freeze that for you and you will be able to we will be able to analyze it then after it all happens.

363
27:56,615 --> 27:57,785
So,

364
27:59,385 --> 28:01,315
14 and a half pounds.

365
28:01,965 --> 28:04,515
3, two, one, zero.

366
28:06,335 --> 28:08,395
And now Professor Trumper is freezing it for you.

367
28:08,635 --> 28:11,425
Now look at this. Look at this incredible picture.

368
28:12,365 --> 28:17,755
I mean, this is truly an eye opener for me when I saw the physics in here is unbelievable.

369
28:18,585 --> 28:20,545
Here is your 14 and 1/2 pounds.

370
28:21,525 --> 28:24,195
Tick marks from here to here are half a second.

371
28:24,575 --> 28:26,605
It was half a second in free fall.

372
28:26,915 --> 28:28,995
And it goes to zero. That's no weight.

373
28:29,685 --> 28:35,565
Now it hits the floor, the cushion, and its weight goes up in something like a tenth of a second.

374
28:35,735 --> 28:40,745
Look, this is about one, two, three, it's about three and a half times its weight now.

375
28:40,995 --> 28:47,675
So the 14 and a half has to be multiplied by three and a half or four, which is exactly what we predicted, that it would be much higher.

376
28:47,885 --> 28:52,885
But now it's being it bounces off because it's a very nice cushion. It throws it back up.

377
28:52,885 --> 28:55,785
So it goes back into the air, so it goes immediately to weightlessness again.

378
28:56,275 --> 29:04,745
And then it oscillates back and forth. And then here, you would expect that this level 14 and a half pounds would be the same as this.

379
29:05,055 --> 29:16,125
And the only reason why that's not the case, there is a little cable that fell with it, which is pushing a little bit up on the upper uh on the upper disc that is there."

380
29:16,125 --> 29:25,315
So it's making it a little lighter. Isn't it incredible? You see here in front of you, the weightlessness, and you see the extra weight when it hits, and again followed by weightlessness.

381
29:25,855 --> 29:28,925
Dave, A+, you pass the course.

382
29:29,165 --> 29:31,235
Yeah."

383
29:32,195 --> 29:38,455
There is a great interest in doing experiments under weightless conditions.

384
29:39,825 --> 29:52,155
NASA was very interested in it. And if you would jump 100 meters up in the sky, you would only be 9 seconds up. You wouldn't even be weightless because of air drag."

385
29:52,795 --> 30:02,205
However, if you could jump up way near the top of the atmosphere where the air drag is negligible, then you would be weightless for quite some time.

386
30:02,585 --> 30:07,445
And that is what people have been doing for the past few decades.

387
30:07,745 --> 30:18,035
Professor Young and Professor Omen here at the Aeronautics department have done what they call zero gravity experiments from airplanes."

388
30:18,035 --> 30:24,425
And I will explain that in detail, but first I want you to appreciate that zero gravity is a complete misnomer.

389
30:24,945 --> 30:28,675
Zero weight, yes. Zero gravity, no.

390
30:28,905 --> 30:40,085
If you have an airplane anywhere near earth, flying, whether the engines are on or whether the engines are off or whether it is free falling, doesn't matter, there is never zero gravity. There is always gravity, thank goodness.

391
30:40,715 --> 30:44,155
But if you're in free fall, indeed, there is no weight.

392
30:44,875 --> 30:52,345
Apart from that, they call them zero gravity experiments, and why not? Maybe it sells better."

393
30:54,595 --> 31:06,445
They fly an airplane which is the KC-135 and they do these experiments at an altitude of about 30,000 feet.

394
31:08,295 --> 31:12,155
Try to clean this as best as I can.

395
31:13,805 --> 31:22,295
The plane comes in at one point in time at an angle of about 45 degrees.

396
31:22,625 --> 31:25,495
There's nothing special about that 45 degrees.

397
31:26,015 --> 31:31,515
Just that's the way it's done. You have to also think of the convenience convenience for the passengers.

398
31:31,975 --> 31:40,585
The speed is then about 400 and 25 miles per hour.

399
31:41,405 --> 31:48,545
So the horizontal component is about 300 miles per hour, and the vertical component is also 300.

400
31:49,705 --> 31:54,435
The air drag is very little. Let's assume for the sake of the argument that the engines are cut.

401
31:54,985 --> 31:58,515
And the plane goes into free fall.

402
31:58,755 --> 32:02,895
It's no different from this tennis ball. It's the same thing.

403
32:03,385 --> 32:04,855
You're going to see a parabola.

404
32:05,615 --> 32:11,615
And so this plane is going to free fall and comes back to this level.

405
32:13,495 --> 32:16,075
And let's analyze this arc, this parabola.

406
32:16,675 --> 32:23,525
Right here at the top, clearly, there will still be 300 m per second in the absence of any air drag.

407
32:24,635 --> 32:40,505
You should be able to calculate with all the tools that you have available how high this goes from this level. In other words, what is the time that the velocity in the Y direction comes to zero?"

408
32:40,505 --> 32:44,485
You can calculate that, and then you know how much it has traveled. Very crude numbers, this is about 900 m.

409
32:45,255 --> 32:57,645
And it will take about 15 seconds to reach this point, so it will take about 30 seconds to go from here to here. And in those 30 seconds, the horizontal displacement is about three and a half kilometers.

410
32:57,645 --> 33:03,415
And all these numbers you should be able to confirm.

411
33:04,395 --> 33:07,645
Right here, the engines are restarted.

412
33:09,205 --> 33:15,535
During this free fall, everyone in the airplane is weightless, including the airplane itself.

413
33:16,305 --> 33:24,235
Now the engine start and the engine is sort of going the plane is going to pull up, goes into this phase, and then the plane flies horizontally for a while.

414
33:24,945 --> 33:38,035
During this phase, as we just discussed, it's like hitting the floor. You need an acceleration in this direction. There will be weight increase.

415
33:38,275 --> 33:44,245
So there is here an acceleration upwards. And during this time, very roughly, people have about twice the weight.

416
33:44,825 --> 33:47,195
And then here they have again normal weight.

417
33:47,595 --> 33:57,365
And then the plane pulls up again, and here it goes and repeats the whole thing again going into free fall.

418
33:57,935 --> 34:08,825
So again, here, people have more than their normal weight. 08, more than normal weight, free fall.

419
34:08,825 --> 34:13,435
And the whole cycle takes about 90 seconds.

420
34:14,765 --> 34:30,205
You can imagine that it's very important when you are here in free fall, when you have no weight, that when your weight comes back and your weight doubles, and Professor Omen told me that this change from zero to twice your weight takes less than a second.

421
34:30,505 --> 34:39,175
That you better know where your feet are and where your head is. Because if your head is down and you all of a sudden double your weight, you crush your skull.

422
34:39,815 --> 34:49,375
So you have to be sure that you're standing straight up in the plane when your weight begins to double, and we will see that very shortly how that works.

423
34:49,825 --> 34:54,825
I want to show you first some slides from these experiments.

424
34:55,765 --> 35:00,925
So here you see the situation that we just described.

425
35:00,925 --> 35:03,355
Let us start here, that is where I started with you.

426
35:04,245 --> 35:06,385
The plane turns the engines off.

427
35:06,715 --> 35:08,005
This is the parabola.

428
35:08,585 --> 35:10,505
Here, the engines are restarted.

429
35:10,915 --> 35:12,935
This is the free fall period.

430
35:13,785 --> 35:15,415
This is about 30 seconds.

431
35:16,315 --> 35:21,305
The engine is restarted and during this time, there is an acceleration upwards.

432
35:21,645 --> 35:27,085
And they call it a 2G peak. Well, they really mean 1G. What they really mean that my weight doubles.

433
35:27,485 --> 35:35,395
They call that 2G. But of course, they call this 0G, which is equally incorrect. It's not 0 G, you have no weight.

434
35:36,225 --> 35:38,815
This is weightless, here your weight is double.

435
35:39,065 --> 35:44,405
Here your weight is normal. Here your weight roughly doubles, and you go into another free fall period.

436
35:44,805 --> 35:48,785
And the cycle from here to here is about 90 seconds.

437
35:49,525 --> 35:58,505
Now, the irony has it that the reason why these flights are done is to study motion sickness under weightless conditions.

438
35:58,745 --> 36:01,255
Astronauts were complaining about motion sickness.

439
36:01,825 --> 36:09,995
And so Professor Young and Omen have done lots and lots of experiments with airplanes and later also in the shuttle to study this motion sickness.

440
36:10,435 --> 36:16,175
I find it rather ironic because if you and I were part of these experiments,

441
36:16,645 --> 36:20,145
we would get terribly sick because of the experiment.

442
36:20,545 --> 36:26,425
Just imagine that you go from weightlessness into twice your weight, back to weightlessness. We would be puking all day.

443
36:26,865 --> 36:33,575
How can you study people who are sick? How can you study the sickness due to weightlessness?"

444
36:34,075 --> 36:35,985
Well, they must have found a way.

445
36:36,835 --> 36:38,895
They do this about 50 times per day.

446
36:39,685 --> 36:48,155
And now I want to show you some real data which were kindly given to me by Professor Young, where you see them actually

447
36:49,045 --> 36:51,245
in the plane.

448
36:52,565 --> 36:56,625
I believe I have to put this on one.

449
36:57,315 --> 37:01,595
And start the"

450
37:01,985 --> 37:03,835
Can you turn off the slide projector?"

451
37:06,855 --> 37:12,855
So here you see them in the plane. They're not weightless, they are climbing up."

452
37:13,415 --> 37:14,485
Right."

453
37:21,285 --> 37:26,265
I think this is Professor Young. Guys lying on the floor must be a bit tired.

454
37:26,675 --> 37:33,585
The lights will shortly go on. And when the light goes on, that's an indication that the weightlessness is coming up.

455
37:34,025 --> 37:40,695
Already went on. I must have missed it. I wasn't looking. And there they go into weightlessness."

456
37:41,575 --> 37:43,455
Swimming"

457
37:44,085 --> 37:45,575
Here this person is upside down here.

458
37:46,025 --> 37:51,855
You better get straight up before you weight doubles, because you crush into the floor.

459
37:52,265 --> 37:55,385
Right"

460
37:58,235 --> 38:00,275
Okay.

461
38:03,415 --> 38:09,145
And now it takes 60 seconds because the whole cycle is 90 seconds.

462
38:10,105 --> 38:19,485
And in these 60 seconds, they get ready for the next free fall for the next weightlessness.

463
38:19,775 --> 38:30,745
And you will see very shortly the light will go on again, and that will tell them that the weightlessness is coming up, and then they will be weightless for another 30 seconds.

464
38:31,095 --> 38:32,655
Right.

465
38:34,605 --> 38:37,905
The sound that you hear is obviously the engines of the plane.

466
38:43,915 --> 38:45,585
There you go. Light goes on, they get a warning."

467
38:46,025 --> 38:50,155
They take their headphones off, everything becomes weightless. They may not like that.

468
38:50,655 --> 38:59,145
And so they put their headphones on in a secure place. You see that here. Professor Young takes his off."

469
38:59,415 --> 39:02,445
And there they go again."

470
39:03,215 --> 39:11,385
Swimming in mid-air, 30 seconds weightless.

471
39:11,875 --> 39:13,755
Okay.

472
39:19,345 --> 39:24,305
And the plane in which this happens,"

473
39:24,795 --> 39:27,305
Yeah, these things happen."

474
39:27,855 --> 39:33,855
I'd like to show you the last slide of the plane that they do these experiments from.

475
39:34,265 --> 39:44,205
This is the plane while it is in free fall, at about 45 degree angle. And these people have done a tremendous job."

476
39:44,845 --> 39:53,425
in indeed making a major contribution to the air sickness due to weightlessness.

477
39:53,845 --> 39:56,645
All right, see you Friday.

478
39:57,135 --> 39:59,765
Okay.

479
49:59,765 --> 50:02,635
