1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:04,429
We will discuss velocities and acceleration.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,070
I'll start with something simple.

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:15,250
I have a motion of an object along a straight line. We call that one-dimensional motion.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:22,370
And I'll tell you that the object is here at time T1, at time T2 it's here, at time T3 it's there.

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,160
Time T4 it's here and at time T5 it's back where it was at T1.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:35,340
And here you see the positions in X where it is located at that moment in time.

7
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:42,590
I will define this to be the increasing value of X.

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,700
It's my free choice, but I've chosen this now.

9
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,360
Now, we will introduce what we call the average velocity.

10
00:00:53,230 --> 00:01:09,330
I put a bar over it, that stands for average, between time T1 and time T2. That we define in physics at X as time T2 minus X at time T1 divided by T2 minus T1.

11
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,150
That is our definition.

12
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:20,080
In our case, because of the way that I defined the increasing value of X, this is larger than zero.

13
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:29,350
However, if I take the average velocity between T1 and T5, that would be zero because

14
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,280
because they are at the same position. So the upstairs is zero.

15
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:47,530
If I had chosen T4 and T2, average velocity between time T2 and T4, you would have seen that that is negative because the upstairs is negative.

16
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,520
Notice that I haven't told you where I choose my zero on my X-axis.

17
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:58,860
It's completely unimportant for the average velocity. It makes no difference.

18
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:08,220
However, if I had chosen this to be the direction of increasing X, then, of course, the signs would flip.

19
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,010
Then this would have been negative and this would have been positive.

20
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,560
So the direction that you are free to choose determines the signs.

21
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:23,180
The location where you put your zero is not important, but signs in physics do matter.

22
00:02:23,760 --> 00:03:33,640
Signs are important. Whether you owe me money or I owe you money, the difference is only a minus sign, but I think it's important for you.

23
00:03:34,619 --> 00:04:44,769
Now, I will give you not only the positions as I did here on the X-axis at discrete moments in time, but I'm going to tell you exactly where the object is at any moment in time.

24
00:04:50,631 --> 00:05:52,611
Here you see an XT diagram. So you see that at T1, the object is at position XT1.

25
00:05:58,681 --> 00:06:02,481
This is the road of the object. This is the straight line where it's moving.

26
00:06:02,741 --> 00:06:08,851
It starts here, then it goes to this position, it goes to this one, it comes back to T4 and it comes back here.

27
00:06:09,231 --> 00:07:14,811
I will tell you now every moment in time in between.

28
00:07:15,591 --> 00:08:25,731
(Drawing sound) Voila.

29
00:08:26,261 --> 00:09:32,171
This is now information that is way more. You have the information at any moment in time.

30
00:09:32,621 --> 00:10:36,711
Notice that I now did choose X = 0.

31
00:10:37,431 --> 00:11:39,111
I chose it somewhere here. But I could have chosen it at any other point.

32
00:11:42,231 --> 00:12:48,791
For whatever follows, you will see that it makes no difference. So I have chosen a zero point so that I can make a graph.

33
00:12:49,481 --> 00:13:54,411
And now we will look at the average velocity in a somewhat different way.

34
00:13:54,861 --> 00:15:05,711
Say I choose my time T2 and T3, I draw here now this line.

35
00:15:06,391 --> 00:16:07,581
(Drawing sound)

36
00:16:08,691 --> 00:17:11,161
And this angle I call alpha.

37
00:17:12,401 --> 00:18:22,531
And this part here, I call delta X and this here is delta T.

38
00:18:23,551 --> 00:19:34,611
And so you could write now, if you careful about your sign convention, you could write down now that the average velocity equals delta X divided by delta T.

39
00:19:35,431 --> 00:20:43,391
But be careful, if the angle is positive, I call this a positive angle, then the average velocity is positive.

40
00:20:44,091 --> 00:21:50,041
But if I have a negative angle, then the average velocity would be negative.

41
00:21:50,481 --> 00:23:05,291
For instance, between T4 and T5, if I draw this line, then this angle here is negative, and so the average velocity between T4 and T5 is now negative.

42
00:23:07,071 --> 00:24:19,501
Again, if I had changed the zero point, you would have found the same values for the average velocity, the only difference would have been the position of the curve in that plot.

43
00:24:21,271 --> 00:25:27,231
There is a very big difference in physics between speed and velocity.

44
00:25:28,111 --> 00:26:35,721
The average velocity between time T1 and T5 is zero, but the average speed is not.

45
00:26:36,541 --> 00:27:49,581
The average speed is defined as the distance traveled divided by the time that it takes to travel that distance.

46
00:27:50,421 --> 00:28:56,621
Now what is the distance that the object traveled between time T1 and time T5?

47
00:28:57,511 --> 00:30:03,451
Well, the object started at a position here on this X-axis.

48
00:30:03,741 --> 00:31:14,481
And then it went up, reached the highest point here. So I'll make a drawing for you here. Reached the highest point here, then it went down.

49
00:31:15,391 --> 00:32:22,341
And then when it went here, it went up again, and it comes down again, and it's back.

50
00:32:22,711 --> 00:33:32,421
And in order to find the average speed, you would now have to know exactly what this distance is, add up this distance, add up this distance, and this distance.

51
00:33:32,731 --> 00:34:49,571
And if that distance all together were for instance 300 m, and if the time between T1 and T5 were 3 seconds, then the average speed would be 300 m divided by 3 seconds, that would be 100 m per second.

52
00:34:49,851 --> 00:35:56,361
So the average speed would be 100 m per second, yet the average velocity would be zero.

53
00:35:57,941 --> 00:37:10,211
If you look at the location T3 and T2, and I bring T3 closer and closer to T2,

54
00:37:10,731 --> 00:38:13,581
then this angle of alpha will increase.

55
00:38:14,261 --> 00:39:20,231
And I can go to the extreme that I bring T3 almost right at T2.

56
00:39:20,621 --> 00:40:25,451
The angle of alpha will then be tangential to this point.

57
00:40:26,261 --> 00:41:30,681
(Drawing sound) This will then be my angle of alpha.

58
00:41:31,491 --> 00:42:39,171
And now you will understand how we define the instantaneous velocity at time T.

59
00:42:39,491 --> 00:43:44,611
Which is different from an average velocity between two time intervals.

60
00:43:44,951 --> 00:45:09,011
The instantaneous velocity V, and I pick a random time T equals the limiting case for X measured at time T + delta T - X measured at time T divided by delta T and I do that for delta T goes to zero.

61
00:45:09,401 --> 00:46:28,831
So think this, think of this as being T3 and this as T2, I bring T3 closer and closer and closer to T2 and the time between them then goes to zero. And this is something that you undoubtedly recognize, that's the first derivative of the position versus time.

62
00:46:29,381 --> 00:47:40,381
And now comes an equation which is one of the very few that I want you to remember in in 801 V equals dX dt.

63
00:47:40,781 --> 00:48:47,541
This is one that you must remember not only in 801, but for the rest of your time at MIT.

64
00:48:47,851 --> 00:49:52,371
And this could be larger than zero, this could be zero, and this could be smaller than zero.

65
00:49:52,821 --> 01:00:09,461
If the angle of alpha, the tangential is positive, then it is a positive value. If it is negative, however, when you're here, then it is a negative velocity. And if the angle of alpha is zero, then it the velocity is zero.

66
01:00:09,831 --> 01:01:15,561
So if we now look at this plot, we can search for the times that the velocity is zero.

67
01:01:15,961 --> 01:02:22,331
So you have to look for the derivative being zero, that means the angle alpha being zero.

68
01:02:22,581 --> 01:03:25,181
Clearly here, the velocity is zero.

69
01:03:25,661 --> 01:04:30,331
Right here at this turning point, that means when the object is here, it is zero.

70
01:04:30,761 --> 01:05:38,171
When the object is here, it is again zero at this moment in time. Again, the angle is zero, and it is again zero here.

71
01:05:38,391 --> 01:06:41,251
So those are the times that the velocity is zero.

72
01:06:41,501 --> 01:07:45,041
What are the times that the velocity is positive? Well, it's positive here.

73
01:07:45,441 --> 01:08:54,551
Velocity is positive here, still positive, positive, becomes negative, negative, positive, zero, negative.

74
01:08:55,341 --> 01:09:59,961
So that's the definition of the instantaneous velocity.

75
01:10:01,421 --> 01:11:04,011
What is the instantaneous speed?

76
01:11:04,531 --> 01:12:08,221
Well, speed is not sign sensitive.

77
01:12:09,021 --> 01:13:17,641
Suppose that the velocity here, just I call that V1, suppose that was + 30 m/s.

78
01:13:17,951 --> 01:14:20,471
I just grabbed this number out of the blue.

79
01:14:20,731 --> 01:15:29,221
And suppose here somewhere, it was, I call that V2, suppose that was - 100 m/s.

80
01:15:29,591 --> 01:16:32,001
This is negative, and this is positive.

81
01:16:32,311 --> 01:17:42,631
Then we would have to say in physics, whether you like it or not, it's not very pleasing, but you would have to say that this velocity is lower than that one, because minus 100 is lower than plus 30.

82
01:17:43,031 --> 01:21:05,321
But the speed, of course, is higher here, because the speed is the magnitude of the velocity and is not sign sensitive. So this has the highest speed of 100 m per second and this has a lower speed, but this has the lowest velocity. It's just an algebraic game, but very important when you make your calculations.

83
01:21:06,341 --> 01:22:15,401
I have always wondered what the average speed or the average velocity is of a bullet.

84
01:22:15,751 --> 01:23:19,011
Now, I want you to realize I'm not a fan of guns at all.

85
01:23:19,341 --> 01:24:20,871
But it always intrigued me.

86
01:24:21,211 --> 01:26:25,911
How can I measure the average speed of a bullet?

87
01:26:26,301 --> 01:28:32,721
And I've discussed it with some people here and we came up with an easy way to do that.

88
01:28:33,141 --> 01:29:37,821
We have a wire which goes into the blackboard.

89
01:29:37,981 --> 01:30:48,361
Wire one, and we have another wire that goes into the blackboard, wire two. And the separation is D meters. We have to measure that.

90
01:30:48,711 --> 01:31:50,141
The setup is here.

91
01:31:50,511 --> 01:32:55,791
So this is wire number one and this is wire number two.

92
01:32:57,151 --> 01:34:05,611
So, you will see the coming in like this. So I'll make this a one and I'll make this a two. That's the way it's set up.

93
01:34:06,371 --> 01:35:12,431
And we fire a bullet which breaks this wire. At that moment, the timer starts.

94
01:35:13,031 --> 01:36:17,601
And then it breaks this wire and that's when the timer stops.

95
01:36:18,271 --> 01:38:26,571
Now, I told you, a measurement is meaningless without knowledge of the uncertainty in your measurement.

96
01:38:27,421 --> 01:40:32,961
So there are two uncertainties involved, the distance and the timing uncertainty.

97
01:40:33,541 --> 01:42:39,351
This distance, I will measure for you D.

98
01:42:39,651 --> 01:44:43,611
I have here a large ruler.

99
01:44:44,581 --> 01:45:47,401
Here is one wire. Here's the other wire.

100
01:45:48,341 --> 01:50:59,251
I cannot do that any better, really, than maybe even half a centimeter, because the situation is not all that stable. I don't know what happens when the bullet will hit the wire.

101
01:50:59,511 --> 02:07:761
So I would say it is 148 and 1/2 cm, but I cannot guarantee it to better than half a centimeter.

102
02:08,131 --> 02:14,761
Rolling 148 and 1/2 plus or minus 0.5 cm.

103
02:16,091 --> 02:21,601
I want you to appreciate that this is a very small percentage error.

104
02:21,921 --> 02:30,211
This is only five parts out of 1500, that is one out of 300. So that is only a 1/3% error.

105
02:30,411 --> 02:33,211
That's very small. That's what we call the relative error.

106
02:33,881 --> 02:42,621
Then I ask myself the question, I want to measure the accuracy of the speed of the bullet to about 2%.

107
02:43,171 --> 02:44,511
That was my goal.

108
02:45,261 --> 02:47,561
How accurate should I do the timing?

109
02:48,191 --> 03:00,731
Well, I had to make an estimate very roughly how fast the speed of the bullet is. And I would think it is probably lower than the speed of sound. The speed of sound is 340 m/s.

110
03:01,031 --> 03:09,171
I don't know whether it's 200 or 300, but it got to be somewhere in that ballpark of the kind of bullets that we have, 200 or 300 m/s.

111
03:09,681 --> 03:14,591
Let us assume that the speed is 300 m/s, just a wild guess.

112
03:15,331 --> 03:21,311
Then it would take 5 milliseconds for this bullet to cross from here to here.

113
03:21,731 --> 03:30,221
And if I want to make a measurement to 2% accuracy, I have to know this timing to about 1/10th of a millisecond.

114
03:30,451 --> 03:36,241
Because 1/10th of a millisecond is about 2% of five.

115
03:36,471 --> 03:40,661
So that sets the accuracy that I need to make the time measurements.

116
03:41,021 --> 03:49,231
And so we do have a timer. It is about accurate to about a 10th of a millisecond. And so now I can measure that time.

117
03:49,461 --> 03:58:151
So I'm going to have here some time that we measure plus or minus 0.1 and we'll do the whole thing in milliseconds.

118
03:58:151 --> 04:06,541
But our final answer will be in meters per second.

119
04:07,871 --> 04:17,411
All right. I always have to think hard when I do this, because when we deal with bullets, that is no kid stuff.

120
04:18,071 --> 04:23,551
And as I said, I have really no experience firing guns.

121
04:24,501 --> 04:25,631
This is the bolt.

122
04:26,471 --> 04:32,231
(Grunting noises as he lifts something heavy) Let it go.

123
04:32,821 --> 04:35,111
Here is the bolt.

124
04:36,121 --> 04:37,861
There we go.

125
04:38,641 --> 04:43,681
(Clanking sounds) It's in place.

126
04:44,231 --> 04:46,311
Before I do that, I want to check check the circuit.

127
04:46,541 --> 04:51,441
I want to make sure that the electronic circuit is properly working.

128
04:51,881 --> 04:54,231
You see the timing here, right?

129
04:54,731 --> 04:58,131
So I do a small test just to see whether the circuit is working.

130
04:58,431 --> 05:02,661
(Beeping sounds) Yeah. Should be working.

131
05:04,171 --> 05:05,781
Here comes the bullet.

132
05:06,331 --> 05:10,711
(Mechanical sounds)

133
05:11,881 --> 05:14,191
You ready? I'm ready.

134
05:14,651 --> 05:16,791
3, 2, 1, 0.

135
05:17,221 --> 05:17,901
(Gunshot)

136
05:18,561 --> 05:19,531
What do we see?

137
05:20,891 --> 05:24,401
5.8 milliseconds.

138
05:26,191 --> 05:30,741
5.8. Is that what you see? Yeah.

139
05:31,411 --> 05:38,701
5.8 milliseconds plus or minus 0.1.

140
05:39,691 --> 05:46,131
So out comes the average call it speed or call it velocity, it's the same thing in this case.

141
05:46,871 --> 05:54,821
148.5 5.8 and I have to convert it to meters per second.

142
05:54,981 --> 06:03,451
That brings it at 256 plus or minus. Now you come in here with your plus or minuses.

143
06:03,911 --> 06:06,791
This is a 1 point a 1/3% error.

144
06:06,981 --> 06:12,061
It's negligible to this one. 1 out of 58 is about 1.7%.

145
06:12,341 --> 06:17,041
So this is the only one we have to worry about. So the uncertainty in there is about 1.7%.

146
06:17,291 --> 06:23,421
It's less than two, that's what I wanted. And that gives me an error of about 4 meters per second.

147
06:23,801 --> 06:34,741
And so this is the result and you see it's only meaningful because we have a good idea about the uncertainties in the measurement.

148
06:36,971 --> 06:46,941
Just as we introduced average accele- average velocity, now I'm going to introduce average acceleration.

149
06:47,581 --> 06:53,641
Notice that the velocity changes here throughout time.

150
06:54,621 --> 07:12,921
And that brings me to the next part, the logical part, namely, that we're going to introduce an average acceleration. And with a little bit of imagination, you can probably guess what that looks like.

151
07:13,521 --> 07:34,171
The average acceleration between time T1 and time T2 would then be the velocity at time T2 minus the velocity at time T1 divided by T2 minus T1 and the dimension is length per second per time squared, so it's meters per second square.

152
07:34,441 --> 07:37,511
This is then for a one-dimensional situation.

153
07:37,941 --> 07:43,091
This number can be larger than zero, it can be equal to zero, and it can be smaller than zero.

154
07:44,421 --> 07:48,351
In our case, T1 to T2, here,

155
07:48,691 --> 08:04,201
notice the velocity is zero as a start, and it begins to increase because this angle of alpha increases. It's the angle that matters. The angle increases, so in our case, from T1 to T2, the average acceleration is larger

156
08:04,541 --> 08:05,391
than zero.

157
08:05,831 --> 08:07,341
Look at the angle.

158
08:07,971 --> 08:16,581
However, if you take the average acceleration between T1 and T5, that is smaller than zero.

159
08:17,321 --> 08:20,631
Because here the velocity is zero.

160
08:20,971 --> 08:23,511
But here the velocity is negative.

161
08:24,201 --> 08:30,641
So if you substitute that in there, you get an average acceleration which is smaller than zero.

162
08:30,951 --> 08:39,641
So the signs in the velocity and the signs in average acceleration depend crucially on how I have defined my increasing value of X.

163
08:39,641 --> 08:41,731
Not where I choose my zero point.

164
08:42,161 --> 08:48,391
If I reverse the direction of increasing X, then all my signs will change.

165
08:48,881 --> 08:58,901
So you can also write down then that average acceleration, if you like that, is delta V divided by delta T, but you must be careful because the delta V is sign sensitive.

166
08:58,901 --> 09:02,361
You must obey your sign convention.

167
09:03,591 --> 09:06,201
I have here a tennis ball.

168
09:06,731 --> 09:11,151
And I can bounce this tennis ball, I can throw it down.

169
09:11,531 --> 09:18,041
And let us assume, just for simplicity, that it hits the floor at about 5 m/s.

170
09:18,341 --> 09:27,321
And that it's a very, very good tennis ball, and that it also bounces back with a speed of about 5 m/s.

171
09:27,731 --> 09:36,151
I will choose this to be my increasing value of X. And so it hits the floor like this.

172
09:36,811 --> 09:43,321
That means the velocity at which it hits the floor is - 5 m/s.

173
09:43,771 --> 09:50,561
It bounces off, and there it comes, and it goes up with + 5 m/s.

174
09:50,961 --> 09:54,701
I call this V1 and I call this V2.

175
09:55,501 --> 10:07,801
So what now is the average acceleration? Well, I would have to know the time that it takes for this change in direction. In other words, we call that the impact time.

176
10:08,341 --> 10:14,661
I would say in this case, the impact time delta T is probably about a hundreds of a second.

177
10:15,621 --> 10:31,811
And so my average acceleration would be V2 - V1, that is + 5 - - 5, that is 10 divided by 10 to the minus 2, and that is + 1,000 m per second squared.

178
10:32,701 --> 10:35,551
I have I've observed carefully the signs.

179
10:35,861 --> 10:42,501
If now, I say, aha, I don't like this, I want to call this the value of increasing X.

180
10:42,871 --> 10:49,141
No big deal. This would become a plus, this would become a minus, and then this would become a minus.

181
10:49,391 --> 10:53,561
So then the acceleration is minus 1000 m per second square.

182
10:54,431 --> 11:04,751
I have also here a tomato, and I have here some eggs.

183
11:06,101 --> 11:17,141
Now, imagine now that I throw the tomato down or for that matter the egg, and that they hit the floor at 5 m/s.

184
11:17,541 --> 11:18,931
I could do that.

185
11:19,341 --> 11:24,201
They would not come back up. They would go (splatting sound).

186
11:24,701 --> 11:34,021
So therefore, the change in velocity would not be 10, apart from the sign that you have to think about, but it would only be five meters per second.

187
11:34,651 --> 11:41,731
The impact time would probably be much longer, maybe a quarter of a second.

188
11:41,981 --> 11:55,431
So therefore, the average acceleration during the impact would then be only 5 divided by 1/4, would be something like 20 m per second square.

189
11:56,091 --> 12:03,651
Now, whether you call it plus or whether you call it minus 20 m per second square, depends on your convention of what you call increasing X.

190
12:04,341 --> 12:09,501
But the eggs and the tomatoes don't care what you call minus and what you call plus.

191
12:09,751 --> 12:17,251
Whether the acceleration is minus 20 m per second square or plus 20 m per second square, you better believe it, the egg will break.

192
12:17,631 --> 12:29,351
So it's only in your convention that it matters, but of course, the physics will not change. The eggs couldn't care less what you have chosen for your sign convention.

193
12:29,851 --> 12:36,551
Something breaks because the magnitude of acceleration becomes too high. That's why something breaks.

194
12:37,291 --> 12:40,851
A few days ago, I saw a Sherlock Holmes movie.

195
12:41,431 --> 12:46,241
And there was a guy who fell on the floor, a marble floor.

196
12:46,531 --> 12:50,551
Hit his head, was lying there motionless.

197
12:51,091 --> 12:52,671
And he was Watson.

198
12:53,271 --> 12:55,751
And Watson said to Sherlock Holmes, what happened?

199
12:56,551 --> 13:04,261
Sherlock Holmes walks over to the guy, touches him, and he says, he crushed his skull.

200
13:04,591 --> 13:07,281
He looked very intelligent, I must say when he said that. He crushed his skull.

201
13:07,621 --> 13:12,581
And I said, gee, that's really physics in action. It's 801 all the way.

202
13:13,451 --> 13:17,301
A modest, a really modest velocity when he hits the floor.

203
13:17,671 --> 13:22,201
But he hit the floor like a billiard ball. The guy was bald for one thing.

204
13:22,531 --> 13:25,481
And so the impact time was very short.

205
13:25,711 --> 13:31,341
And when the impact time is short, even if you hit the floor with a modest speed, the acceleration is high.

206
13:31,581 --> 13:37,111
And that was too much. And so that's why his skull was crushed.

207
13:38,891 --> 13:43,211
So what matters is the change in velocity and the impact time.

208
13:44,401 --> 13:56,331
We now want to make one last step from average acceleration, we want to go to the acceleration at any moment in time.

209
13:56,531 --> 13:59,651
Just the way we did that with velocity.

210
14:00,221 --> 14:19,711
And that now is a natural step. The acceleration at any moment in time would be the limit for delta T goes to zero for V measured at T + delta T - VT divided by delta T.

211
14:20,801 --> 14:34,301
So that is the instantaneous acceleration. And this, you will recognize, is the first derivative of velocity versus time, which is also the second derivative of position versus time.

212
14:34,741 --> 14:49,811
And so here comes the second equation that I really want you to remember forever and ever and ever that the acceleration is dVdT, which is also d2x dt squared.

213
14:50,211 --> 14:52,981
(Drawing sound)"

214
14:54,991 --> 15:11,011
We can go to our plot and we can ask ourselves the question now, where is the acceleration zero, where is it larger than zero, and where is it smaller than zero? Because this value can be larger than zero, equal to zero, and smaller than zero.

215
15:11,481 --> 15:17,541
And now you have to be very careful when you try to derive that from this plot.

216
15:17,861 --> 15:23,151
You have to be very careful. Because you and I have no good feeling for second derivative.

217
15:23,421 --> 15:26,331
Velocity is easy. All you have to do is looking at alpha."

218
15:26,681 --> 15:31,401
But when it comes to the second derivative, you have to see how alpha is changing.

219
15:31,881 --> 15:41,961
Well, right here, the velocity is not changing. So the acceleration everywhere here must be zero.

220
15:42,651 --> 15:49,471
Here the velocity is increasing. So the acceleration must be larger than zero here.

221
15:50,381 --> 15:55,741
Here, the velocity is almost constant. It's almost a straight line.

222
15:56,261 --> 15:59,951
What does that mean for the acceleration? Zero.

223
16:00,311 --> 16:00,951
Exactly.

224
16:01,301 --> 16:07,511
Here when it makes this rounding curve, the velocity is positive here, but on this side it's negative.

225
16:07,801 --> 16:10,991
So what does that mean for the acceleration? Negative. You got it.

226
16:11,511 --> 16:21,281
And so you can now roughly find where the acceleration is positive, where it's negative and where it is zero.

227
16:23,141 --> 16:38,551
That's do a straightforward example the way that you could expect it on an assignment or if you're extraordinarily lucky, you might even get something like that on an exam.

228
16:38,971 --> 16:49,211
Very straightforward. I'm going to give you the position X as a function of time and then ask you lots of questions about it.

229
16:49,801 --> 17:03,841
So this example is a working example X = 8 - 6t + t^2.

230
17:04,601 --> 17:08,441
So this tells you where the where the object is at any moment in time.

231
17:08,651 --> 17:10,501
And let this be in meters.

232
17:11,531 --> 17:14,701
What now is the velocity at any moment in time?

233
17:15,261 --> 17:19,091
Well, that's the derivative dX dt.

234
17:19,561 --> 17:34,511
And I use the following X equals t to the power n, then, as most of you should know, dX dt is then n * t to the power n - 1.

235
17:34,801 --> 17:36,601
That's all I'm using.

236
17:37,341 --> 17:41,451
So the derivative of 8 is 0. I get here - 6.

237
17:41,921 --> 17:45,111
I get here plus 2t.

238
17:45,661 --> 17:48,091
This would be in meters per second.

239
17:48,421 --> 17:54,111
And the acceleration, I have to take the derivative of the velocity, I get + 2.

240
17:54,651 --> 18:02,521
So notice that the acceleration is constant in time, is not changing, but the velocity is changing.

241
18:03,971 --> 18:14,061
Well, at time T = 0, just I'll start to probe a little bit. I want to get a feeling for what this object is doing.

242
18:14,451 --> 18:26,671
At time T = 0, X is + 8. The velocity is - 6 meters per second and the acceleration equals + 2.

243
18:27,191 --> 18:36,381
I can also ask myself, at what time is X = 0? What are the times that X is zero?

244
18:36,381 --> 18:51,391
Well, I have to solve this second order equation, which is something that you've all done in high school, and you will find that that's the case when the time is + 2 and when the time is + 4.

245
18:51,751 --> 19:04,441
Take the + 2, that makes this 4. 4 + 8 is 12 - 6 * 2, that's zero. So you see the two works and you check that the four also works.

246
19:05,981 --> 19:14,181
Just for my curiosity, when is the velocity zero? Oh, that's easy. That's when this equation is zero, so that's when T equals 3.

247
19:15,171 --> 19:18,751
What is at that moment the position?

248
19:18,751 --> 19:26,581
Oh, I substitute t = 3 in here and that gives me -1. X equals -1.

249
19:27,721 --> 19:34,181
So now I'm ready to plot X as a function of T. It's of course a parabola.

250
19:34,491 --> 19:38,521
And I use this information that we have just derived.

251
19:39,011 --> 19:45,941
So here comes my plot.

252
19:46,461 --> 19:51,621
Let this be increasing value of X. Let this be 8.

253
19:52,561 --> 19:56,251
And let this be -1.

254
19:56,891 --> 19:58,441
This is the time axis.

255
19:58,711 --> 20:01,321
I have a zero here.

256
20:01,901 --> 20:08,181
And so I want to cover, let's say, about 6 seconds.

257
20:07,501 --> 20:17,661
So I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

258
20:18,611 --> 20:28,721
Now I'm going to use this information in order to give you a curve which is similar to that one, except this is a simple one. This is just a parabola.

259
20:29,071 --> 20:34,581
So I know that at time t = 0, the object is at position 8.

260
20:35,601 --> 20:47,551
I know that X is 0 at the time 2 and at the time 4. So the object is here at this time and at this time.

261
20:48,481 --> 20:56,261
And I know that at time t = 3, it is at position minus 1.

262
20:56,621 --> 21:02,121
And I also know that the velocity is zero, so we can check that.

263
21:02,621 --> 21:11,321
And so if I make this plot now, then we would get a curve that sort of like this.

264
21:11,841 --> 21:17,311
And yes, indeed, notice the velocity here is zero. The angle alpha equals zero.

265
21:18,051 --> 21:27,511
The object starts out at T = 0 with a negative velocity.

266
21:27,811 --> 21:29,181
You can see that.

267
21:29,601 --> 21:32,321
The object at T = 0 is here. This is where the object is."

268
21:32,581 --> 21:35,391
I hope you realize that the object is never here.

269
21:35,661 --> 21:39,761
This is the road. This is the one-dimensional track on which the object is sitting.

270
21:39,991 --> 21:43,441
The object is here and it starts going in this direction.

271
21:43,771 --> 21:49,711
If it starts going in this direction, the velocity must be less than zero. And indeed it is, it's - 6.

272
21:50,671 --> 21:55,521
But there is the acceleration, which is + 2. It's in this direction.

273
21:55,781 --> 22:01,061
The acceleration says, I don't want you to go down. I want you to go up.

274
22:01,481 --> 22:07,401
Well, the velocity says, sorry, all I can do is slowly, slowly change. And that's what it's doing.

275
22:07,721 --> 22:12,601
It's slowly changing the velocity, and there comes a time that the velocity is zero.

276
22:12,911 --> 22:21,301
So the object goes down. The velocity changes. And when it is at position minus 1, it has come to a grinding halt.

277
22:21,701 --> 22:23,211
And now it is returning.

278
22:23,461 --> 22:27,951
This positive value of A is now increasing the velocity. And that's what you see.

279
22:28,411 --> 22:42,211
I therefore bet you a nickel that if you substitute in that equation, T equals 4, that the velocity better be positive. It has changed from a minus sign to a plus sign because of this positive acceleration.

280
22:42,621 --> 22:44,281
I bet you a nickel.

281
22:44,661 --> 22:46,551
T equals 4.

282
22:47,391 --> 22:49,111
What is X? Uh what is V?

283
22:49,381 --> 22:51,321
We want to know V.

284
22:51,721 --> 22:54,681
8 minus 6, plus 2 m per second.

285
22:55,211 --> 22:57,001
You see, physics works.

286
22:57,321 --> 22:59,691
V is now plus 2 m per second.

287
23:00,431 --> 23:05,231
So all that information is in there, but I want you to be able to also digest it.

288
23:05,471 --> 23:11,751
Don't look at that curve at just some dumb parabo- some dumb curve. Try to imagine what is happening.

289
23:12,371 --> 23:18,761
And only then do you get some insight, then you really begin to get it in your brains.

290
23:20,181 --> 23:49,511
I now would like to write down in most general form, the equation for the position and the velocity as a function of time for a one-dimensional motion whereby the acceleration is constant. So it's going to be one dimensional again, and we have A is going to be a constant.

291
23:45,201 --> 23:49,511
And so the equation that I write down is the most general way that I can write it down.

292
23:49,891 --> 24:01,801
So we're going to get X equals some number c1 plus some c2 * T plus some c3 * T squared.

293
24:01,961 --> 24:06,561
And notice, oh, I already erased my example. My example is gone.

294
24:06,561 --> 24:17,661
But you would have seen this was an eight before, and here we had uh what did we have minus 6t and we had plus 1 t squared.

295
24:18,251 --> 24:30,511
So you recognize these three. I can now take the derivative and so I get C2 + 2 C3 T.

296
24:31,811 --> 24:37,601
And then I get the acceleration equals 2 C3.

297
24:38,051 --> 24:43,971
And now we get some insight into these these quantities.

298
24:44,481 --> 24:54,431
Clearly, X1 C1 is the position of X at time T = 0, for which we often write an X0.

299
24:54,801 --> 24:58,471
Because when T is zero, that is where X is.

300
24:59,701 --> 25:09,741
C2 is really the velocity at time T = 0, because when T is zero, that's when C2 is V.

301
25:10,511 --> 25:21,681
And the acceleration is not changing with time is 2 C3. Therefore C3 is half the acceleration.

302
25:22,221 --> 25:28,171
So this gives you some insight in the meaning of these quantities and you can see you can read now some some physics in there.

303
25:28,591 --> 25:41,491
C1, C2 and C3 can independently be either zero or larger than zero or negative, makes no difference, each one of these combinations is a valid possibility in physics.

304
25:43,641 --> 25:52,591
When we have gravity, an object is influenced by the gravitational acceleration.

305
25:53,251 --> 25:56,951
And the gravitational acceleration is a constant.

306
25:57,321 --> 26:02,871
And we write often for that gravitational acceleration, the letter G.

307
26:03,231 --> 26:18,331
Whether I drop an object or throw it vertically up or I throw it vertically down, it's all one dimensional. It becomes two dimensional when I throw it at an angle, I keep it one dimensional, the acceleration is always the same.

308
26:18,841 --> 26:27,511
And that G, the gravitational acceleration in Boston is 9.80 m per second square.

309
26:27,511 --> 26:31,301
And it varies a little bit for different places on Earth.

310
26:31,951 --> 26:54,411
This gravitational acceleration is independent of the mass of the object that I drop, of the speed of the object, of the chemical composition of the object, of the size of the object, and of the shape of the object, assuming that we have no air drag, assuming that these experiments are done in in vacuum.

311
26:54,971 --> 27:02,241
Is it obvious that the gravitational acceleration is independent of all these quantities?

312
27:02,501 --> 27:03,251
By no means.

313
27:03,751 --> 27:06,351
Is it true? We think so.

314
27:06,731 --> 27:13,021
But I want you to appreciate that it is not obvious and it cannot be proven from first principle.

315
27:15,391 --> 27:24,341
Remember last time, we dropped an apple from 3 meters and we dropped another one from 1 and 1/2 meters.

316
27:24,831 --> 27:39,981
And in your second assignment, which you haven't seen yet, I'm asking you to calculate the gravitational acceleration for me using these both experiments, and of course, I want you to also tell me what the uncertainty is in your final answer.

317
27:40,391 --> 27:56,241
And I'd like to help you a little bit to set it up and also to get these equations in terms of gravity. Whenever we deal with gravity, we get the G in there.

318
27:56,611 --> 28:01,361
So suppose here is the object at time T = 0.

319
28:01,771 --> 28:13,821
It was the apple, and I call that position X0, I call that zero. I'm free to choose my zero position, and I drop it at zero speed. I just let it go because that's the way we did it in class.

320
28:14,181 --> 28:17,791
The object goes down, and it hits the floor.

321
28:18,481 --> 28:29,241
Well, the general equations now, which deal in gravity, if I call this the increasing value of X,

322
28:29,681 --> 28:33,881
You can choose it differently. This is my choice today.

323
28:34,221 --> 28:46,101
is the following. X equals X0 + V0t + 1/2 gt squared.

324
28:46,381 --> 28:53,461
And g now is 9.80 m/s square.

325
28:54,201 --> 29:00,951
The velocity at any moment in time equals V0 plus GT.

326
29:01,261 --> 29:05,151
And the acceleration is constant is simply G.

327
29:06,081 --> 29:12,191
Now, in my case, I have chosen t = 0, x0 is 0 and I've chosen this zero.

328
29:12,471 --> 29:13,531
So these go.

329
29:14,641 --> 29:26,291
And so you see that when the object is here, which is 3 meters below this point, and you know the time how long it took to get there, that you can now calculate G.

330
29:26,711 --> 29:29,571
Because X would be then 3 meters, that's when it's here.

331
29:30,161 --> 29:36,711
We made a measurement in class, how long it took, so you know the time, and so you can come up with a value for G.

332
29:36,711 --> 29:45,751
And you can do that for both measurements, and of course, I want you to tell me also what the uncertainty is in those measurements.

333
29:46,401 --> 29:56,671
Remember that we derived last time that C that the time that it takes for the apple to fall was C times the square root of h over G.

334
29:56,941 --> 29:58,861
And we never knew what that C was.

335
29:59,351 --> 30:04,011
I did a demonstration to show you that the time is proportional to the square root of h. We never knew what that C was.

336
30:05,371 --> 30:12,171
Now you know, because now you have the equations here, and you'll see that that C simply was the square root of 2.

337
30:12,561 --> 30:16,471
But I could not derive that from my dimensional analysis.

338
30:19,961 --> 30:28,371
Now, I want you to relax and at the same time get a little bit alert for a change.

339
30:29,601 --> 30:33,401
Look at this situation, V equals GT.

340
30:34,251 --> 30:41,331
That means when I drop an apple, and I'm going to drop another one today, that the velocity increases with time.

341
30:41,931 --> 30:54,111
So if I strobe this apple while it was falling, I would see the separation when it strobes to increase with time because the velocity goes up with time.

342
30:55,461 --> 31:02,991
I have here an apple or I'm going to put an apple up about 3 meters from the floor.

343
31:03,881 --> 31:10,801
3 meters. So the height is 3 meters approximately.

344
31:11,121 --> 31:21,351
We know from last time, remember we did it, it was about 780 milliseconds to hit the floor. I will just round it off and I think about it about 8/10 of a second.

345
31:21,891 --> 31:23,111
Just to get an idea.

346
31:24,191 --> 31:37,491
If I flash, if I strobe it twice per second, we call that 2 hertz. So my strobe is two times per second.

347
31:38,871 --> 31:44,581
Then I should hit that ball when it's falling twice with my strobe light.

348
31:45,271 --> 31:51,301
I don't know where it is though. Because when we strobe it and when I let the apple go, the two are not synchronized.

349
31:51,561 --> 31:57,341
So maybe the first time that the light blinks, it may be here, and the second time it may be here.

350
31:57,581 --> 32:01,771
But it's also possible that the first time it's here, and the second time is there.

351
32:02,401 --> 32:08,071
And so the first thing I want to do is to test your alertness. We will blink."

352
32:08,511 --> 32:10,661
You will tell me where you see them.

353
32:11,121 --> 32:13,171
But we will take a picture.

354
32:13,801 --> 32:17,701
We will take a picture which will show us exactly where those two balls were.

355
32:18,161 --> 32:26,441
So that's the first alertness test. So get ready for this and then we will do a second one which is even more intriguing.

356
32:26,961 --> 32:39,461
So now I have to first lower this velvet so that we get a nice dark background.

357
32:39,641 --> 32:41,171
(Mechanical sounds)

358
32:41,171 --> 32:48,761
There we go.

359
32:48,761 --> 33:00,541
(Mechanical sounds) Wow. With my fingerprints on it, it's not so black anymore.

360
33:00,861 --> 33:01,771
There it is.

361
33:02,111 --> 33:03,541
That's the background.

362
33:03,921 --> 33:19,501
(Loud mechanical sounds) Oh, what am I doing? I need the ladder again. I have to bring the apple up. Friday is always a bad day for me.

363
33:19,841 --> 33:20,731
Okay.

364
33:21,841 --> 33:28,191
So now I'm going to bring the apple up. There is some metal here, it's an electromagnet.

365
33:28,441 --> 33:32,961
And so I throw a switch here so that the electromagnet is activated.

366
33:33,561 --> 33:35,821
Very similar to what we did last time.

367
33:36,211 --> 33:38,181
We have to put the apple up.

368
33:38,891 --> 33:40,801
And the apple is hanging there.

369
33:41,221 --> 33:42,191
There we go.

370
33:42,661 --> 33:51,091
(Mechanical sounds)

371
33:51,601 --> 34:02,881
So now I have to start the uh the strobe.

372
34:03,241 --> 34:09,201
(Rhythmic beeping sound) That's about 2 Hz. That's about two flashes per second.

373
34:09,741 --> 34:12,141
And I'm going to make it pitch black.

374
34:12,431 --> 34:17,191
(Sound of lights turning off)

375
34:17,351 --> 34:26,461
(Beeping continues)"

376
34:26,461 --> 34:28,931
I will countdown 3210.

377
34:29,391 --> 34:34,331
And Bob there, who is behind the camera, will open the shutter when I say one.

378
34:35,321 --> 34:38,201
And when I say zero, the ball will fall.

379
34:38,681 --> 34:44,301
So you may always see the ball in its highest position. That may not count there, of course.

380
34:44,491 --> 34:50,391
Because it makes two flashes in the time that the shutter is open and that I drop it.

381
34:50,941 --> 34:53,861
Okay, if you're ready? I'm ready.

382
34:54,091 --> 34:56,291
Make it as dark as we can.

383
34:56,861 --> 34:58,251
Bob, are you ready?

384
34:58,351 --> 34:58,791
Ready.

385
34:59,071 --> 35:01,811
Class ready?

386
35:01,811 --> 35:02,271
Yeah.

387
35:02,471 --> 35:03,511
Everyone ready?

388
35:03,941 --> 35:05,531
You don't look ready.

389
35:05,801 --> 35:06,921
(Laughter) Okay.

390
35:07,561 --> 35:11,081
3, 2, 1,

391
35:11,501 --> 35:13,401
(Clicking sound) That was zero.

392
35:14,321 --> 35:17,591
So let's look at this again in slow motion.

393
35:18,211 --> 35:22,121
(Beeping sound)"

394
35:22,121 --> 35:29,811
So, now we are developing that picture, and I would like you to tell me where you saw the balls.

395
35:30,231 --> 35:31,981
(Murmuring from audience)"

396
35:32,591 --> 35:34,271
Where were they roughly?

397
35:34,591 --> 35:35,701
Where was the first one?

398
35:35,931 --> 35:39,051
How much, how much below the highest point?

399
35:39,561 --> 35:40,731
Only this much?

400
35:40,731 --> 35:43,201
(Audience response) Yeah."

401
35:42,401 --> 35:43,201
The first one?

402
35:43,881 --> 35:46,401
And then the second one was pretty low then."

403
35:46,401 --> 35:47,001
Yeah.

404
35:47,431 --> 35:47,991
Okay.

405
35:48,571 --> 35:51,101
Sounds interesting. We'll take a look.

406
35:51,511 --> 35:59,501
While the picture is developing, I'm now going to test your real alertness.

407
36:00,441 --> 36:16,461
I'm going to strobe it with an unknown frequency, unknown to you. I will tell you a secret, it's a higher frequency. You're going to see more balls on the way down.

408
36:16,741 --> 36:19,881
I'm not going to ask you where they are exactly.

409
36:20,251 --> 36:24,191
All I want you to tell me afterwards, how many you saw.

410
36:24,541 --> 36:25,191
That's all.

411
36:25,681 --> 36:31,721
So count them as it falls. You know, you have only 0.8 seconds to count.

412
36:32,061 --> 36:33,081
(Laughter)

413
36:33,491 --> 36:35,381
Bob, how did the picture come out?

414
36:35,381 --> 36:35,851
Good.

415
36:36,161 --> 36:36,591
Good.

416
36:36,971 --> 36:40,721
(Slide projector sound) Wow, you're good.

417
36:40,951 --> 36:41,851
Oh!

418
36:42,161 --> 36:48,611
You're good. It was very high actually, the first uh the first flash, very high.

419
36:49,101 --> 36:52,091
(Audience murmuring)

420
36:52,491 --> 36:58,461
You see, it's you did very well.

421
36:58,461 --> 37:03,921
We are going to start now with the second part.

422
37:04,231 --> 37:10,341
(Mechanical sounds)"

423
37:12,291 --> 37:15,121
Is the audio restored?

424
37:15,511 --> 37:17,021
Should be.

425
37:17,501 --> 37:20,371
So, I uh activated the magnet again.

426
37:20,591 --> 37:22,361
(Mechanical sounds)

427
37:22,901 --> 37:27,861
There it is.

428
37:28,371 --> 37:39,461
(Loud mechanical sounds) Oh, my goodness.

429
37:39,461 --> 37:41,021
(Beeping sound)"

430
37:41,411 --> 37:43,211
(Mechanical sounds)

431
37:43,541 --> 37:45,241
Working?

432
37:45,241 --> 37:45,901
Working.

433
37:46,141 --> 37:47,481
Okay, thank you, Bob.

434
37:47,781 --> 37:53,861
Okay, Bob, if you're ready? I'm ready. Going to make it as dark as we can.

435
37:54,281 --> 37:58,211
So all I want you to tell me how many balls will you see.

436
37:58,441 --> 37:59,471
All right, ready?

437
37:59,751 --> 38:01,081
Bob, you okay?

438
38:01,081 --> 38:01,521
Okay.

439
38:01,861 --> 38:05,471
3, 2, 1,

440
38:05,721 --> 38:06,491
(Clicking sound)

441
38:06,631 --> 38:09,031
(Audience response)"

442
38:09,501 --> 38:10,411
Well.

443
38:10,721 --> 38:13,141
(Audience response)"

444
38:13,581 --> 38:14,861
Who saw three?

445
38:15,201 --> 38:16,931
Four.

446
38:16,931 --> 38:18,151
(Audience response)"

447
38:17,741 --> 38:18,151
Four.

448
38:18,491 --> 38:20,081
Five.

449
38:20,081 --> 38:21,741
(Audience response)"

450
38:21,271 --> 38:22,501
Four. I want to know four.

451
38:22,821 --> 38:24,411
Five.

452
38:24,411 --> 38:26,011
(Audience response)"

453
38:25,701 --> 38:26,601
Five. Here is a five.

454
38:26,831 --> 38:27,821
There is a five.

455
38:28,661 --> 38:31,051
Another five?

456
38:31,321 --> 38:31,921
Who saw six?

457
38:32,021 --> 38:33,761
(Audience response) Wow."

458
38:33,861 --> 38:34,741
Seven.

459
38:34,741 --> 38:35,731
(Audience response)"

460
38:35,731 --> 38:36,311
Eight.

461
38:36,891 --> 38:37,771
Nine.

462
38:37,771 --> 38:39,051
(Audience response)"

463
38:39,051 --> 38:39,611
10.

464
38:40,291 --> 38:41,071
11.

465
38:41,831 --> 38:44,711
Who's just saw a blur?

466
38:44,711 --> 38:46,111
(Laughter)"

467
38:46,871 --> 38:48,641
Those are the real winners, I think."

468
38:48,911 --> 39:02,061
Well, I'll tell you, it was 10 Hz. Since it is 0.8 seconds, depending upon where you hit it, how lucky you are. I will show you, you will either see seven or maybe eight balls.

469
39:02,721 --> 39:04,231
But it was a good test.

470
39:04,841 --> 39:13,221
And for those of you who thought that it was only that only saw five,

471
39:13,521 --> 39:15,361
There you see them. Let's count them.

472
39:15,911 --> 39:17,521
Let's count them together.

473
39:18,251 --> 39:28,641
One, this is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. This is a bounce.

474
39:29,031 --> 39:35,441
So for those of you who saw five, I would say take some rest this weekend, you'll need it. And I'll need it too. See you Monday.
