00:00:00,488 --> 00:00:05,268
Today we're going to talk about friction.

2
00:00:06,388 --> 00:00:09,408
Something Please.

3
00:00:10,438 --> 00:00:12,838
I have a terrible cold. My voice is down.

4
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:16,698
Help me to get through this with my voice.

5
00:00:16,928 --> 00:00:17,648
Thank you.

6
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,848
We're going to talk about friction, which we have never dealt with.

7
00:00:22,338 --> 00:00:25,678
Friction is a tricky thing. Not as easy as you may think.

8
00:00:26,918 --> 00:00:30,768
I have an object on a horizontal surface.

9
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:35,638
The object has a mass M, gravitational force mg.

10
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:39,698
This is the Y direction.

11
00:00:41,478 --> 00:00:42,998
This could be the X direction.

12
00:00:44,518 --> 00:00:52,498
There must be a force pushing upwards from the surface to cancel out mg because there is no acceleration in the Y direction.

13
00:00:53,038 --> 00:01:01,758
We normally call that the normal force because it's normal to this surface, and it must be the same as mg, otherwise there would be an acceleration in the Y direction.

14
00:01:02,758 --> 00:01:09,118
Now, I am going to push on this object with a force force Walter Lewin.

15
00:01:09,558 --> 00:01:13,588
And we know that the object in the beginning will not start accelerating.

16
00:01:14,048 --> 00:01:14,968
Why is that?

17
00:01:14,968 --> 00:01:22,748
That's only possible because there is a frictional force which adjusts itself to exactly counter my force.

18
00:01:23,668 --> 00:01:31,588
I push harder and harder and harder, and there comes a time that I win, and the object begins to accelerate.

19
00:01:32,198 --> 00:01:40,388
It means that the frictional force, which is growing all the time as I push harder, reaches a maximum value which it cannot exceed.

20
00:01:41,178 --> 00:01:47,908
And that maximum value that the friction can achieve, this is an experimental fact,

21
00:01:48,788 --> 00:01:55,738
is what's called the friction coefficient mu, which has no dimension, times this normal force.

22
00:01:56,868 --> 00:02:02,888
We make a distinction between static friction coefficient and kinetic.

23
00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:06,528
This is to break it loose, to get it going.

24
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:10,828
This is to keep it going when it already has a certain velocity.

25
00:02:11,238 --> 00:02:14,398
The static is always larger than the kinetic.

26
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,848
for reasons that are quite obvious.

27
00:02:16,848 --> 00:02:22,298
It's a little harder to break it loose. Once it's going, it's easier to keep it going.

28
00:02:23,788 --> 00:02:30,978
It is fairly easy to measure a friction coefficient by putting an object on an incline

29
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:39,138
and by changing the angle of the incline, increasing it. This is the angle alpha.

30
00:02:40,018 --> 00:02:44,688
You increase it to the point that the object start to slide down.

31
00:02:45,688 --> 00:02:47,318
Here is the object.

32
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,948
This is the gravitational force mg

33
00:02:51,958 --> 00:03:04,538
which I will decompose in two forces, one in the Y direction, which I always choose perpendicular to the surface, and another one in an X direction.

34
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:11,478
You're free to choose this plus or this plus. I will now choose this the plus direction.

35
00:03:12,348 --> 00:03:13,918
I'm going to decompose them.

36
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:23,648
So I have one component here, and this component equals mg times the cosine of alpha.

37
00:03:24,408 --> 00:03:33,608
And I have a component in the X direction which is mg sin alpha.

38
00:03:34,758 --> 00:03:44,088
There is no acceleration in the Y direction, so I can be sure that the surface pushes back with a normal force N.

39
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:52,948
And that normal force N must be exactly mg cosine alpha because those are the only two forces in the Y direction and there is no acceleration in the Y direction.

40
00:03:53,678 --> 00:03:58,508
So this one must be mg cosine alpha.

41
00:03:59,758 --> 00:04:02,598
Now, this object wants to slide downhill.

42
00:04:03,048 --> 00:04:05,108
Friction prevents it from doing so.

43
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:09,278
So there's going to be a frictional force in this direction.

44
00:04:10,268 --> 00:04:19,368
And as I increase the tilt, this frictional force will get larger and larger and larger, and then there comes a time that the object will start to slide.

45
00:04:20,138 --> 00:04:25,318
Let us evaluate that very moment that it's just about to break loose.

46
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:36,288
I'm applying Newton's second law. In this direction now, the acceleration is still zero, but the frictional force has now just reached the maximum value.

47
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:50,738
Because I increase alpha, so this component will get larger, and this component will get larger, this component will get larger, this component is still holding its own, but then all of a sudden it can't grow any further and it starts to accelerate.

48
00:04:51,558 --> 00:05:02,518
So Newton's second law tells me that mg sin alpha minus FF maximum at this point is zero.

49
00:05:03,448 --> 00:05:11,418
And this one is mu static times N, which is mg cosine alpha.

50
00:05:12,118 --> 00:05:17,658
This one is mg sin alpha is equal zero.

51
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:24,288
I lose my mg and you see that mu of S equals the tangent of alpha.

52
00:05:24,638 --> 00:05:26,028
It's that easy to measure.

53
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:30,478
So you increase the tilt, we will do that later, until it starts to slip.

54
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:37,548
And then at that critical angle that it starts to slip, you have a value for mu of S for the static friction coefficient.

55
00:05:38,508 --> 00:05:46,088
It is very non-intuitive that this friction coefficient is completely independent of the mass. The mass has disappeared.

56
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:49,178
Think about that. It's very non-intuitive.

57
00:05:49,898 --> 00:05:55,398
If you double the mass, the angle would be the same, given the fact that you have the same kind of object.

58
00:05:55,728 --> 00:06:03,058
The friction coefficient only depends on the materials that you have, the materials that are rubbing over each other.

59
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:10,738
It's also independent of the surface area that is in contact with this incline, which is equally non-intuitive.

60
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:13,668
It's very non-intuitive.

61
00:06:14,188 --> 00:06:18,978
But we will see that that's quite accurate within the uncertainties that we can measure it.

62
00:06:20,378 --> 00:06:28,948
If you have a a car and you park your car, you throw it on the brakes and you put it at an angle and you increase the angle of the slope,

63
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:35,318
the friction coefficient for rubber on concrete is about one, so the tangent is one, so the angle is about 45 degrees.

64
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:39,948
So if the road were 45 degrees, the car would start to slide.

65
00:06:41,048 --> 00:06:43,788
Independent of the mass of the car.

66
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:50,228
No matter whether it's a truck or whether it is a small car, independent of the width of the tires, doesn't enter into it.

67
00:06:50,488 --> 00:06:52,088
Even though you may think it does.

68
00:06:52,548 --> 00:07:00,738
They would both start to slide at the same angle, given the fact, of course, the same road and the same kind of rubber.

69
00:07:02,448 --> 00:07:08,768
I first want to show you some of this which is at first very qualitative.

70
00:07:09,378 --> 00:07:12,468
I don't want it to become quantitative yet.

71
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:25,988
The difficulty with these experiments are, I'm going to use this plank here, that the moment that my fingers touch this plank or touch the bottom of any of the objects that I'm going to slide,

72
00:07:26,648 --> 00:07:28,188
then all hell breaks loose.

73
00:07:28,188 --> 00:07:32,598
A little bit of water on the plank would locally make the friction coefficient large larger.

74
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,858
My fingers have chalk on them.

75
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:39,348
A little bit of chalk on a local place would make the friction coefficient go down.

76
00:07:40,188 --> 00:07:43,458
That's why at this point we'll keep it a little qualitative.

77
00:07:44,238 --> 00:07:52,508
The first thing I want to show you is if I take a rubber puck and I put the rubber puck on this incline,

78
00:07:53,228 --> 00:07:57,948
and I have a plastic bin, which is quite smooth, I put it on here,

79
00:07:58,428 --> 00:08:04,348
that it's immediately intuitive that the friction coefficient of this plastic bin will be lower than of the rubber puck.

80
00:08:04,758 --> 00:08:11,018
So when I increase the angle, you expect that first the plastic bin will start to slide and then the rubber puck.

81
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:16,438
And if I gave you the angles at which that happened, you could actually calculate the two values for the friction coefficient.

82
00:08:16,888 --> 00:08:19,248
Which I will not do now, but I will do that later.

83
00:08:19,818 --> 00:08:26,158
So all I want you to see, I hope, that this one will go earlier than that one.

84
00:08:26,818 --> 00:08:28,778
I'm going to increase the tilt.

85
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:38,258
I do it very slowly. I try not to rock the boat too much.

86
00:08:39,588 --> 00:08:49,378
Very slowly. We must be approaching the critical angle for the plastic. Boy, it's holding on to itself. There it goes.

87
00:08:50,378 --> 00:08:52,318
And the rubber goes a little later.

88
00:08:54,338 --> 00:09:02,268
The rubber can be made rough by rubbing it on one side, in which case the angle will be even larger.

89
00:09:03,678 --> 00:09:08,858
I told you that the friction coefficient is independent of the mass of the object.

90
00:09:09,118 --> 00:09:11,318
I have two identical bins here.

91
00:09:12,358 --> 00:09:16,468
Well, as far as they can be identical. Maybe one at the bottom is a little rougher than the other.

92
00:09:16,938 --> 00:09:21,248
But in one, I'm going to put 200 grams, which is about five times the weight of the bin.

93
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:26,148
And then, when I tilt them, they will go at the same angle.

94
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:28,328
Because it's independent of the mass.

95
00:09:29,648 --> 00:09:38,398
So let's try that again and see how close they are. It may be off by half a degree or 1 degree, of course, because the plank is not uniform everywhere.

96
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:48,918
I'm now at 18 degrees, 19 and 1/2, 20, 20 and 1/2, 21, and the other one is 21.2.

97
00:09:49,268 --> 00:09:57,688
So they almost go at the same time. So you've seen that apparently the mass has a very small if any effect.

98
00:09:58,818 --> 00:10:05,278
Now comes something that I always find very, very non-intuitive, and that is surface area.

99
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:08,178
I have two pieces of wood

100
00:10:08,438 --> 00:10:09,828
and they're identical.

101
00:10:09,998 --> 00:10:13,888
Whatever that means identical. You can never make them exactly the same in terms of roughness.

102
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:23,658
This surface we prepared as well as we prepared this bottom surface, but this bottom surface here is four times smaller an area than this surface here, the flat part.

103
00:10:24,308 --> 00:10:28,328
I'm going to put the flat one here.

104
00:10:29,678 --> 00:10:34,668
And I am going to put the same object but with its small area here.

105
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:43,698
If indeed the friction coefficient is independent of surface area, then when I tilt them, they should start to slide roughly at the same angle.

106
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:46,038
There we go.

107
00:10:47,868 --> 00:10:53,568
14 degrees, 16,

108
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:56,928
18, one goes,

109
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:58,838
and the other one follows within two tenths of a degree.

110
00:59,748 --> 01:04,578
And the reason why there's always some difference, of course, the plank is not exactly uniform.

111
01:04,708 --> 01:08,468
Have to be careful that I don't touch the critical surfaces.

112
01:09,078 --> 01:19,088
So you have seen difference in friction coefficients and you have seen there is almost no effect on surface area and there is no effect on uh on the mass.

113
01:19,808 --> 01:21,948
And that is both very non-intuitive.

114
01:22,448 --> 01:25,458
The width of the tires of your car does not matter.

115
01:26,148 --> 01:34,708
And that I I ask you the question to explain in your assignment number three, why race cars have very wide tires. There must be a reason for that.

116
01:35,168 --> 01:36,518
I want you to think about that.

117
01:38,508 --> 01:51,038
There is another way that one can measure the friction coefficient, which is way more complicated and really that's not the reason why I want you to see it.

118
01:51,648 --> 01:59,638
The reason why I want you to go with me through these arguments is that you begin to see how subtle and how really difficult friction is.

119
02:00,888 --> 02:08,558
I am going to put an object now on an incline again, as we did before.

120
02:09,368 --> 02:18,328
And instead of having it sit on its own, I'm going to attach to it a string.

121
02:19,208 --> 02:20,878
So here is that object.

122
02:22,908 --> 02:29,398
And here is a string and a pulley and here is string.

123
02:29,988 --> 02:35,948
And here is an object mass M2, and this object has mass M1.

124
02:36,578 --> 02:40,578
And the angle here alpha.

125
02:41,938 --> 02:45,468
I'm looking for my green chalk. I want to use the same color convention.

126
02:45,998 --> 02:50,018
Now, let's look at all the forces that we can think of.

127
02:50,468 --> 02:52,368
Here is M1 G.

128
02:53,628 --> 03:02,758
Let's decompose that in Y and X direction. And I will call this direction Y as I always do perpendicular to the surface.

129
03:03,438 --> 03:04,608
So we call this Y.

130
03:07,328 --> 03:11,378
And I will call this direction now the positive X direction.

131
03:12,258 --> 03:14,388
You're free to choose it any way you want to.

132
03:16,478 --> 03:22,278
The force here is M2g.

133
03:27,428 --> 03:29,248
And now comes a major problem.

134
03:29,838 --> 03:42,858
The biggest problem is that you do not know in advance whether this system will start to accelerate in this direction or whether it will start to accelerate in this direction, or whether it will not accelerate at all.

135
03:42,988 --> 03:43,868
It's quite possible.

136
03:44,788 --> 03:51,958
And all these three cases, as you will see, have to be dealt with independently. You cannot do it with one equation, as you will see.

137
03:53,008 --> 03:56,768
Let's first decompose this force as we did before,

138
03:57,458 --> 03:59,218
in the Y direction.

139
03:59,948 --> 04:05,448
So this one equals M1g cosine alpha.

140
04:06,698 --> 04:16,468
And this one, the X component, which is in the minus X direction now, equals M1 g sin alpha.

141
04:17,728 --> 04:28,108
Clearly, this one, M1g cosine alpha, we never have to worry about. There is no acceleration in the Y direction. So this normal force N will kill this one,

142
04:28,748 --> 04:32,248
and this is M1 g cosine alpha.

143
04:32,698 --> 04:38,738
So you never have to worry about the Y direction. We know there's no acceleration. We only deal with forces in the X direction that are of interest.

144
04:39,278 --> 04:44,088
There is a tension in this string.

145
04:45,178 --> 04:46,528
And now comes the problem.

146
04:46,918 --> 04:50,438
I do not know in what direction the frictional force is.

147
04:50,938 --> 05:00,838
If this object has the tendency to go uphill, which I don't know yet, then the frictional force is in this direction, because it opposes always the direction which the object wants to go.

148
05:01,148 --> 05:07,038
If, however, this object wants to go in this direction, which I do not know, then the frictional force has to be put in this direction.

149
05:07,678 --> 05:10,218
And I don't know that.

150
05:11,058 --> 05:21,298
The only thing I do know is that the maximum value of the friction will be mu static times N, which is what we had there.

151
05:21,298 --> 05:31,218
Remember that's the maximum value that the friction can have times M1 g cosine alpha.

152
05:31,758 --> 05:32,518
That I know.

153
05:33,678 --> 05:41,048
So now, if I want to deal with this, I have to look at three complete different situations.

154
05:41,658 --> 05:51,018
Acceleration in this direction, in which the friction is pointing here, acceleration in this direction, in which the friction is pointing there, or no acceleration at all.

155
05:52,748 --> 05:54,748
There is also, of course, the tension here.

156
05:57,188 --> 06:01,848
And this tension is exactly the same as that tension. We discussed that last time.

157
06:01,848 --> 06:13,868
I will not go over that because this is an ideal, and of course an unphysical situation. The pulley has no mass, the pulley is completely frictionless, and the string has no mass. It's a massless string.

158
06:14,758 --> 06:20,378
And I argued last time that therefore the tension here must be the same as the tension there.

159
06:20,948 --> 06:22,208
We even know the tension.

160
06:22,978 --> 06:31,078
I'm going to evaluate for now only situations that the system is at rest. It's not yet moving.

161
06:31,538 --> 06:36,808
If the system is at rest, T must be M2g, because this object is not being accelerated.

162
06:37,438 --> 06:48,318
So we already know that all situations where the system is at rest, T must be M2 G. That's non-negotiable. It's this T as well as that T.

163
06:49,048 --> 06:54,258
Now I have to start splitting in the following situation.

164
06:54,738 --> 07:05,098
My first option is that I make the assumption that the system is just, just about to start accelerating upwards.

165
07:05,668 --> 07:07,198
It isn't doing it yet.

166
07:07,688 --> 07:09,698
It is just about to do that.

167
07:10,428 --> 07:19,198
If that's the case, then I know that the frictional force will be in this direction and it will have reached the maximum value.

168
07:19,918 --> 07:22,178
with the static friction coefficient.

169
07:22,658 --> 07:26,968
Now I can write down in the X direction Newton's second law.

170
07:27,988 --> 07:37,018
Now I have T which is in the positive direction minus M1g sin alpha

171
07:37,968 --> 07:44,258
minus FF max that now has to be zero.

172
07:45,268 --> 07:50,878
Just at the moment that it is just about to change its mind and start accelerating.

173
07:51,848 --> 08:08,328
Now I know what T is that is M2g. So M2g equals M1 g sin alpha plus the maximum frictional force, which is this value.

174
08:09,838 --> 08:16,328
So this is just at the moment that it wants to start sliding.

175
08:16,828 --> 08:24,028
Therefore, if I make mass M2 a hair larger, just a hair, it will go.

176
08:24,758 --> 08:34,388
And therefore, the moment that I make this a larger sign, I know that it's going to accelerate uphill. That's the criterion for going uphill.

177
08:35,888 --> 08:38,418
Now I look at situation two.

178
08:39,348 --> 08:48,918
Now I make the assumption that the object, still standing still, is just about to start accelerating downhill.

179
08:49,148 --> 08:49,778
Aha.

180
08:50,158 --> 08:57,858
If that's the case, I know that the maximum force is now pointing upwards, the same magnitude, but it has now a different direction.

181
08:58,458 --> 09:04,598
So now I can write down Newton's second law. So the frictional force is now helping T.

182
09:05,558 --> 09:12,438
So now we get T plus FF max minus M1 g

183
09:13,318 --> 09:19,918
sin alpha equals zero.

184
09:21,588 --> 09:24,238
We know that this is M2g.

185
09:24,888 --> 09:36,328
So M2g equals M1 g sin alpha minus FF max.

186
09:37,108 --> 09:39,768
Notice the difference, there's a plus sign here, there's a minus sign here.

187
09:41,018 --> 09:54,078
This is the object is still not moving, but if I make M2g a hair less, just a teeny little less, it will definitely start to accelerate downwards.

188
09:54,468 --> 10:00,938
So, if I make this a smaller than sign, the object will start accelerating downhill.

189
10:01,838 --> 10:05,348
This is condition one, this is condition two.

190
10:06,008 --> 10:10,568
If the condition is neither one nor two,

191
10:10,828 --> 10:15,258
what do you think will happen then?

192
10:15,828 --> 10:18,798
It's very possible that you don't meet any one of these two conditions.

193
10:19,678 --> 10:22,818
What do you think will happen?

194
10:23,518 --> 10:24,538
Can't hear you.

195
10:25,728 --> 10:27,478
It won't move. A is zero.

196
10:28,108 --> 10:36,058
Because this these both cases is going to accelerate. So in all other cases, the acceleration equals zero.

197
10:36,678 --> 10:48,528
And the frictional force in this case will adjust itself just the right way so that Newton's second law in the X direction will give you for the force a zero.

198
10:49,498 --> 10:57,068
Let us take a very simple example so that you see this at work.

199
10:58,258 --> 11:13,138
So we have an example here. And in my example, I have M1 = 1 kg, M2 = 2 kg. Can't pick the can't make the numbers much simpler.

200
11:13,678 --> 11:16,968
I take alpha equal 30 degrees.

201
11:17,668 --> 11:29,478
I take a static friction coefficient which is 0.5 and I take a kinetic friction coefficient which is a little less, which is 0.4.

202
11:31,058 --> 11:38,798
The question is now, is it going accelerated uphill or accelerated downhill or no acceleration at all?

203
11:39,218 --> 11:43,958
What it comes down to is that we have to evaluate these three terms.

204
11:44,588 --> 11:52,418
Let's first take M2g. M2g equals 20. We'll just take for g 10, that is just easier.

205
11:53,658 --> 11:57,638
M1g sin alpha. The sin of alpha is a half.

206
11:58,378 --> 12:00,408
So that is five.

207
12:00,968 --> 12:06,378
M1g sin alpha equals 5.

208
12:07,238 --> 12:10,978
And what is FF maximum?

209
12:11,908 --> 12:21,268
I have to use for my friction coefficient 0.5. I have to use for M1 1, here a 10 and have the cosine for 30 degrees.

210
12:21,838 --> 12:32,188
And what I find, you have to take my word for it, that this is about 4.33. And I want to remind you, I have used the static friction coefficient.

211
12:32,558 --> 12:39,038
This is in Newtons. I never put a capital N for Newtons because that is very confusing with this normal force.

212
12:39,218 --> 12:43,828
All my units are always in SI units. So the force is always in Newtons.

213
12:44,908 --> 12:46,868
Aha. We're well on our way.

214
12:47,608 --> 12:50,328
Let's first test whether condition one is met.

215
12:50,958 --> 12:57,768
Is 20 larger than 5 + 4.33?

216
12:59,518 --> 13:02,428
And the answer is yes, it is.

217
13:03,098 --> 13:08,168
So we know that it's going to be accelerated uphill. That is non-negotiable.

218
13:09,468 --> 13:17,528
So now I could ask you a simple question. What is the acceleration and what is the tension in the string?

219
13:18,208 --> 13:22,068
And so you will think, oh well, that is within arm reach.

220
13:22,718 --> 13:23,758
Not quite.

221
13:24,458 --> 13:27,058
Because things are now going to change.

222
13:28,598 --> 13:42,088
If it is going to be accelerated uphill, then at least I know one thing, which I'm going to put in this drawing now. I know that this is the maximum friction possible,

223
13:42,728 --> 13:53,658
which now becomes mu kinetic times M1 times g times cosine alpha.

224
13:54,868 --> 13:57,288
So that is already one change. It is moving.

225
13:57,708 --> 14:02,658
For sure, it's going to be accelerated. So the frictional force is in this direction has this value.

226
14:03,768 --> 14:08,328
So let's write down now Newton's second law in the X direction.

227
14:09,528 --> 14:16,378
So we have T in the positive direction minus M1g sin alpha

228
14:17,838 --> 14:27,998
minus this maximum force, minus mu K M1 g cosine alpha.

229
14:28,658 --> 14:35,718
And that now, according to Newton's law, must be M1 * A, if A is the acceleration uphill.

230
14:36,938 --> 14:42,048
One equation with two unknowns. You don't know A and you don't know T.

231
14:43,868 --> 14:45,008
Or do you know T?

232
14:45,958 --> 14:47,948
What is T? What is the tension?

233
14:48,928 --> 14:50,268
What is the tension?

234
14:50,948 --> 14:56,078
What is the tension when that thing is being accelerated uphill?

235
14:56,638 --> 14:58,868
Anyone has the courage to try?

236
14:59,688 --> 15:03,698
You think M2G. You couldn't be more wrong.

237
15:04,888 --> 15:07,308
It's now moving, it's being accelerated.

238
15:07,968 --> 15:11,208
That means this object is going to be accelerated down.

239
15:11,978 --> 15:15,758
And if this force is the same as this, it can never accelerate down.

240
15:16,838 --> 15:18,488
This T must get smaller.

241
15:19,078 --> 15:26,508
Remember, an object in an elevator being accelerated down loses weight. It's losing weight.

242
15:27,728 --> 15:32,168
This object must be accelerated down. We have to take that into account.

243
15:32,518 --> 15:51,408
So the tension once it start accelerating will go down. So I have a second equation for object number two, I call this the plus direction. So for object number two, I have M2 g - T = M2 * A.

244
15:51,718 --> 15:54,958
It is very important that you see that the tension will change.

245
15:56,278 --> 15:58,538
Now I have two equations with two unknowns.

246
15:59,208 --> 16:01,378
And now I can solve.

247
16:01,968 --> 16:06,448
It's very easy. You just add them. And I leave you with that. I'll just give you the results.

248
16:07,518 --> 16:20,498
I find that the acceleration A equals plus, I think 3.85, that is correct. + 3.85 m/s squared.

249
16:21,058 --> 16:27,778
And I find that the tension equals 12.3 Newtons.

250
16:29,498 --> 16:31,668
I want to dwell on this a little bit.

251
16:32,248 --> 16:34,618
I find for the acceleration a plus sign.

252
16:35,058 --> 16:42,438
Had I found a minus sign, I would, I'm sure I would have made a mistake. Why is it mandatory that I find a plus sign?

253
16:43,238 --> 16:44,918
Absolutely mandatory.

254
16:45,498 --> 16:46,948
Who wants to try that one?

255
16:47,698 --> 16:48,518
Yeah.

256
16:48,828 --> 16:54,918
Well you put the friction in the direction to oppose uphill acceleration, so the acceleration direction you found the friction is the other direction.

257
16:55,508 --> 16:58,948
Yeah. You say, you say it well, I would have said it slightly differently.

258
16:59,468 --> 17:02,278
We know that the acceleration is in this direction. We derive that.

259
17:02,938 --> 17:08,568
Therefore the acceleration, since I call that the plus X direction, that was my plus sign, must come out plus.

260
17:08,988 --> 17:12,108
So if this comes out negative, you've made a mistake.

261
17:12,768 --> 17:16,488
I also want this number to be less than 20.

262
17:17,168 --> 17:22,198
If not, I've made a mistake. Why does that number have to be less than 20?

263
17:23,898 --> 17:26,778
Mass two is pulling down so the weight has to be less than 20.

264
17:26,778 --> 17:27,348
Exactly.

265
17:27,848 --> 17:29,638
This object is going down.

266
17:30,118 --> 17:32,908
To put it the way we put it last time, it lost weight.

267
17:33,358 --> 17:40,568
It's accelerated downwards. This MTG, which is 20, better wins it from T, otherwise it would never be accelerated down.

268
17:40,858 --> 17:43,898
So this plus sign is a must, and this is a must.

269
17:44,218 --> 17:50,598
And if you find not a plus sign but a minus sign, you have to go back to your calculation because you've made a mistake.

270
17:52,358 --> 17:58,838
Now, we take the same situation. I leave everything unchanged, but I make the second mass M2

271
17:59,758 --> 18:04,308
I make it 0.4 kg.

272
18:05,758 --> 18:14,138
So now all the numbers remain the same that we have there, except that M2g now becomes four.

273
18:15,308 --> 18:17,268
Now I'm going to test again.

274
18:18,028 --> 18:30,918
Is M2g, which is four, is that larger than 5 + 4.33?

275
18:32,188 --> 18:33,378
The answer is no.

276
18:34,158 --> 18:35,998
Going to test for my second case.

277
18:36,488 --> 18:43,908
Is M2g smaller than 5 - 4.33?

278
18:44,488 --> 18:45,968
The answer is no.

279
18:46,578 --> 18:47,968
So what do we conclude?

280
18:48,818 --> 18:49,438
Doesn't move.

281
18:49,848 --> 18:51,868
What must be our conclusion?

282
18:52,558 --> 18:55,488
Condition one is not met. Condition two is not met.

283
18:56,128 --> 18:56,838
Doesn't move.

284
18:57,268 --> 19:00,468
Conclusion is A is zero.

285
19:01,008 --> 19:04,568
The object will not be accelerated.

286
19:06,488 --> 19:14,458
And the frictional force is going to adjust along the X direction so that the acceleration indeed is zero.

287
19:15,178 --> 19:16,968
How does the frictional force do that?

288
19:17,378 --> 19:24,048
This is that slope. Here is that object. I will only put in the forces along the X direction.

289
19:24,598 --> 19:32,028
I don't bother about the Y direction. I know that there is M1g sin alpha. And that one is five.

290
19:33,368 --> 19:37,188
So we have here the component of gravity,

291
19:37,768 --> 19:43,948
which is the M1 g sin alpha, and we know that that is five. We had it there.

292
19:44,828 --> 19:59,558
I also know that we have tension here and the tension must be M2g because the object is not being accelerated. We're back where we were. Number two is not being accelerated. The tension is four.

293
20:00,808 --> 20:04,168
5 Newtons downhill, 4 Newtons uphill.

294
20:04,588 --> 20:07,668
What will the friction be? How large and in what direction?

295
20:08,728 --> 20:09,628
Uphill?

296
20:10,268 --> 20:12,558
How large? One. Exactly.

297
20:13,868 --> 20:20,648
The friction will adjust itself so that there is equilibrium, that nothing is going.

298
20:21,918 --> 20:30,158
All right. I now would like to do a few demonstrations whereby I want you to calculate the friction coefficients for me.

299
20:30,678 --> 20:47,528
So we're going to put a particular object on that incline. And I first going to raise the angle until it breaks loose. So you should be able to calculate what the friction coefficient is using the equation tangent alpha equals muS.

300
20:48,018 --> 20:54,868
And the object that I use for that is this this box.

301
20:55,528 --> 21:02,458
In this box is a little weight. That's not very important. It makes the whole thing 361 g.

302
21:03,228 --> 21:09,988
So I want you to know that the weight of this object is 300 at 61 g. I'll write it down for you here.

303
21:12,448 --> 21:19,648
So the mass of the object is 361. I'm sure that the uncertainty is at least 1 g.

304
21:21,518 --> 21:23,918
You have to trust me when I give you the angles.

305
21:24,388 --> 21:33,458
I'm going to increase the incline and there comes a moment that it will start to slide. I'll give you the angle and I want you to calculate that friction coefficient.

306
21:34,008 --> 21:34,978
So we'll do that first.

307
21:35,888 --> 21:36,748
There we go.

308
21:38,668 --> 21:41,298
Now 10 degrees.

309
21:41,958 --> 21:42,958
11.

310
21:43,998 --> 21:46,848
12 and 1/2, 13.

311
21:47,348 --> 21:48,808
14, 15.

312
21:49,978 --> 21:59,238
16, 17, 17 and 1/2, 18, 19, 19 and 1/2, 20.

313
22:00,258 --> 22:00,948
20 degrees.

314
22:01,408 --> 22:04,818
It starts to slide at about 20 degrees. Write that down.

315
22:06,538 --> 22:17,218
Now, I'm going to do exactly this experiment, put a rope over it with a pulley and put M2 on this side.

316
22:17,808 --> 22:23,958
And now I'm going to load down M2 to the point that it starts to slide uphill.

317
22:24,678 --> 22:28,978
That should allow you to also calculate the friction coefficient.

318
22:29,458 --> 22:39,298
You have all the tools for it because once you know that it is just at the point of breaking and going uphill, you know that that equal sign of that equation holds.

319
22:39,948 --> 22:43,988
And so you should be able to calculate the static friction coefficient.

320
22:44,428 --> 22:48,818
Would you find exactly the same number as you find from this experiment? Not very likely.

321
22:50,048 --> 22:52,848
You have to think about that for yourself. Wood has grain.

322
22:53,698 --> 23:01,748
And the grain in this direction could be very different from the grain in this direction. But it would be interesting to compare the two numbers to see how much they're off.

323
23:02,878 --> 23:10,738
So I'm going to put here this rope over here and I'm going to set the angle now at a given value.

324
23:11,248 --> 23:19,698
So this is now non-negotiable. I set it at 20.

325
23:20,668 --> 23:26,388
Again, you see it wants to go. We just saw that at 20 degrees it wants to go.

326
23:26,928 --> 23:34,728
So I prevent it from going. And so I'm going to put a little weight on here.

327
23:35,418 --> 23:40,598
Now there is 100 grams and it's not going. It's happy and it's sitting there.

328
23:41,828 --> 23:42,638
A is zero.

329
23:43,178 --> 23:57,358
That condition isn't met and this condition isn't met. So now you must write down in your notebook that alpha now, it's an independent experiment, equals 20.0 maybe plus or minus one.

330
23:58,588 --> 24:01,868
I think it's about one degree accuracy that I can do.

331
24:02,798 --> 24:11,508
Okay, I'm going to load here more weight, more mass, I should say, at M2, and I'll give you the numbers and when it breaks loose, you will see it, I'll give you the number.

332
24:12,018 --> 24:14,888
Now, I've done this many times, believe me.

333
24:15,698 --> 24:23,328
And the breaking point is not always at the same mass. The mass could differ by 20, 25 grams easily.

334
24:23,838 --> 24:33,708
So whatever number we're going to find for M2, I would say you should at least allow an uncertainty of about something like 25 grams.

335
24:34,948 --> 24:44,368
Just because I've done it many times and I know, it could even be worse at times. The humidity could change in the room and that could change the friction coefficient.

336
24:45,128 --> 24:47,168
Okay, we have 100 grams on it.

337
24:48,148 --> 24:49,668
We have 200 grams on it.

338
24:50,648 --> 24:51,708
250.

339
24:53,248 --> 24:54,368
260.

340
24:55,378 --> 24:58,738
270. And it goes at 270. Did you see it go?

341
24:59,858 --> 25:01,768
started to slide at 270.

342
25:02,308 --> 25:09,508
So at 270 grams, I met exactly that condition with an equal sign.

343
25:09,888 --> 25:18,518
That should allow you to calculate the static friction coefficient, and you'll get a chance to do that in your third assignment.

344
25:19,998 --> 25:29,068
When I had this thing up here and when I was loading this down, making it heavier and heavier, I hope you realize that at first it wanted to slide in this direction.

345
25:29,828 --> 25:32,648
So at first the friction was in this direction.

346
25:33,328 --> 25:44,248
As I loaded it down more and more, the friction became less and less and less. There comes even a time that the friction becomes zero.

347
25:44,908 --> 25:49,058
I loaded it more and more and more, the friction flips over to the other side.

348
25:49,428 --> 25:55,788
The friction the friction grows and grows and grows, fights a heroic battle to not make it go uphill.

349
25:56,278 --> 26:02,528
Loses the battle at one point, reaches the maximum value, I put a little bit more on here, and it goes.

350
26:03,198 --> 26:14,608
So this frictional force is really having a rough time, starting off in this direction, slowly becoming less, becoming zero, changing direction, reaching a maximum, and finally losing the battle.

351
26:15,308 --> 26:17,888
Friction is often a pain in the neck, as we all know.

352
26:18,568 --> 26:27,518
Friction causes wear, it causes tear, and it costs fuel. It's a car, there's a lot of friction with the road. You pay for that.

353
26:27,888 --> 26:34,558
And people try to reduce friction with bearings and with lubrication, oil.

354
26:35,278 --> 26:37,448
Water is an amazing lubricant.

355
26:38,918 --> 26:48,198
If it starts raining and there is a little bit of dust on the road, the friction coefficient between your tires and the road can become so low that you begin to hydroplane.

356
26:48,628 --> 26:53,248
and that you literally that your friction coefficient goes almost to zero.

357
26:54,118 --> 26:55,908
It happened to me once and it's no fun.

358
26:56,498 --> 27:07,378
Can happen instantaneously, particularly when the rain begins, in the very early part of the rain when the road is dusty. So you get the water with a little bit of dust mixed. That's a very dangerous situation.

359
27:08,848 --> 27:11,488
At home, I have a pan.

360
27:11,968 --> 27:17,548
This is my pan at home. Actually, I have more than one pans at home, believe me. But this is a very special pan.

361
27:18,028 --> 27:23,148
And what is special about it is something that I discovered purely by accident.

362
27:23,978 --> 27:28,618
And I want to share with you this um remarkable pan.

363
27:32,598 --> 27:40,058
You see, when I rotate this cover, there's a lot of friction. You can hear it. And it stops.

364
27:41,148 --> 27:42,468
You can hear it, right?

365
27:43,468 --> 27:52,718
And so one evening I was boiling potatoes and I was looking at this pan and I walked up to it because I wanted to check the potatoes, and I touched this thing,

366
27:53,698 --> 27:55,138
and there was no friction.

367
27:55,618 --> 27:57,458
It just went spinning and spinning and spinning.

368
27:57,718 --> 28:01,588
I couldn't believe my eyes until I realized what is happening.

369
28:02,128 --> 28:11,328
Water had accumulated in the rim of this pan, and the cover was beginning to hydroplane.

370
28:15,978 --> 28:18,018
I'm putting water in it now.

371
28:22,378 --> 28:25,748
You almost don't hear it anymore.

372
28:27,068 --> 28:28,118
Isn't that amazing?

373
28:31,558 --> 28:32,818
Almost frictionless.

374
28:33,388 --> 28:44,338
So now the water acts like a lubricant, and you try it with your pen, it won't work because you need just the right shape, you need the right edge to um be able to lubricate it that way.

375
28:46,278 --> 28:56,428
In there are many experiments that are done and many attempts have been made by people to reduce friction.

376
28:57,218 --> 29:01,968
You try, if you can, to avoid contact between two surfaces.

377
29:02,538 --> 29:04,538
That you can do by putting a lubricant in between.

378
29:05,068 --> 29:12,328
But even better it would be if you could separate the objects completely and only have air in between them.

379
29:12,888 --> 29:17,668
Because air has much less friction than a liquid.

380
29:18,578 --> 29:21,568
And that has been done with great success.

381
29:22,198 --> 29:30,988
People use hovercrafts. So they blow air out from below, so the craft lifts itself up, and now it's no longer in contact with the water.

382
29:31,338 --> 29:38,588
It's above the water. So if it moves now, all it has to overcome is the air friction, and that's it. And that helps tremendously.

383
29:39,688 --> 29:47,918
You will be seeing in this lecture hall many demonstrations that I will be doing in the future with what is what I call an an air track.

384
29:48,198 --> 29:49,538
I will show it to you in a minute.

385
29:50,138 --> 29:58,118
It is a long call it a bar for now. Cross section is a triangular shape,

386
29:58,588 --> 29:59,868
and there are holes in here.

387
30:01,288 --> 30:03,618
And we blow air out of that.

388
30:04,258 --> 30:12,968
And on top of that are devices which have been specially designed to perfectly fit this triangle.

389
30:13,738 --> 30:18,288
And when you start blowing the air, they are lifted up, so they float.

390
30:18,808 --> 30:26,718
And so now when you give them a little tap, they can move almost, not quite, but almost without friction.

391
30:28,028 --> 30:29,518
Here is one.

392
30:32,428 --> 30:33,898
Lot of friction.

393
30:35,518 --> 30:37,298
Now I'll turn on the air.

394
30:41,588 --> 30:47,928
Look at the difference. Isn't that amazing? It's floating on its own air cushion.

395
30:58,188 --> 31:05,398
And if I turn it off, the moment that the air stops, you will see stops.

396
31:07,318 --> 31:15,368
So this is a technique that is often used to do demonstrations if you have to do them with a minimum of friction.

397
31:16,338 --> 31:25,438
Of course, you could do experiments in the shuttle very well where you have again, only air around you. But that's of course a very expensive way.

398
31:25,758 --> 31:33,568
In 26100, we will use the air track when we start colliding objects and try to see what happens before and after the collision.

399
31:34,538 --> 31:47,578
There is another device which is very intriguing and that also acts on the idea that it lifts itself up as a result of gas which is flowing out.

400
31:48,168 --> 31:57,458
In this case, it's a container of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide in here, which is solid.

401
31:57,458 --> 31:58,288
And there is a small opening here.

402
31:58,988 --> 32:05,298
And this is an extremely

403
32:05,298 --> 32:06,818
well machined flat surface.

404
32:07,138 --> 32:07,738
Very flat.

405
32:08,138 --> 32:12,428
And the whole thing rests on an extremely flat surface.

406
32:13,068 --> 32:20,978
Because of the room temperature, the carbon dioxide will start to evaporate and will start to flow out.

407
32:21,888 --> 32:38,718
And therefore under this thing comes a film, very thin layer of carbon dioxide. And now you can move this around in two dimensions. You're not stuck like you are there to one dimension only going back and force on what we call the air track, but now you can move it around over this whole surface.

408
32:39,178 --> 32:47,528
And that allows you to do very interesting things as I want to show you next.

409
32:48,408 --> 32:49,738
First make it dark.

410
32:58,819 --> 33:03,149
And we filled that can with dry ice, that is solid carbon dioxide.

411
33:04,749 --> 33:12,339
Now you know solid carbon dioxide is very cold. This white stuff is just frost that's gathered on the outside of the can.

412
33:13,719 --> 33:21,919
Now as the can absorbs heat from the room, the carbon dioxide evaporates and turns into a gas.

413
33:22,519 --> 33:31,789
The gas takes up more room than the solid, so it has to go somewhere. Can't come out the top. So it comes out a little hole here in the bottom of the disc.

414
33:33,129 --> 33:42,769
Now you can't see it coming out the hole, but if I make a flame, I think you can see that there's gas coming out and blowing the flame.

415
33:44,669 --> 34:05,399
Now if we put the disc with its stream of gas coming out the bottom, down on our table top, which is made of a very smooth piece of plate glass, we can wait a moment while the gas coming out builds up pressure underneath, which it has to do in order to escape.

416
34:07,249 --> 34:12,489
By now the disc is floating on this film of escaping gas.

417
34:15,659 --> 34:29,309
That film is so thin that I'm sure you can't see it from out there. I can scarcely see the the see a space between the disc and the glass myself. But if you'll come and look over my shoulder, I think I can show you that there is a space

418
34:30,469 --> 34:36,739
by slipping underneath the disc this piece of tin foil I took off a chewing gum wrapper.

419
34:37,319 --> 34:52,919
Now we'll slip the tin foil between the disc and the plate glass top of the table, showing that there is indeed a space, a thin film of gas between the disc and the glass upon which it's resting.

420
34:54,679 --> 35:01,899
The purpose of this is simply to reduce the friction to a point where we won't have to worry about it or measure it in our experiments today.

421
35:02,649 --> 35:04,929
It's fun to play with this thing. Let me show you.

422
35:06,189 --> 35:11,339
I'll give it a little push, just a little one.

423
35:12,329 --> 35:17,499
And there it goes, moving sedately, no sign of slowing up.

424
35:18,269 --> 35:19,369
Come on back.

425
35:21,429 --> 35:22,919
Same thing the other direction.

426
35:25,019 --> 35:30,119
It takes only a very tiny force to start it in motion. Let me show you that.

427
35:30,686 --> 35:31,386
You take a feather.

428
35:31,866 --> 36:09,356
(Music playing)

429
36:09,356 --> 36:33,766
(Music playing)

430
36:33,766 --> 37:14,566
(Music playing)

431
37:14,566 --> 37:39,486
(Music playing)

432
37:39,486 --> 37:43,956
(Music playing)

433
37:44,288 --> 37:45,828
So you see, fleas are good for something.

434
37:46,528 --> 37:48,818
Have a good weekend. See you Monday.

435
37:49,518 --> 37:56,868
(Applause and indistinct chatter)
