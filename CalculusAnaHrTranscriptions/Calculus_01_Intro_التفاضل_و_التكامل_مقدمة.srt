00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:20,839
Peace be upon you.

2
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:27,079
This video, God willing, will be an introduction to the topic we will talk about in the upcoming course,

3
00:00:27,979 --> 00:00:32,139
which is... Calculus.

4
00:00:34,349 --> 00:00:43,609
And Calculus, we know it by the name Differentiation and Integration.

5
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:52,119
What brought a word like Calculus to Differentiation and Integration? Let's clear up the ambiguity of this naming first, and then continue our discussion.

6
00:00:52,669 --> 00:00:54,819
Calculus consists of two main branches.

7
00:00:54,819 --> 00:01:03,399
One is called Differential Calculus.

8
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:11,589
The other is called Integral Calculus.

9
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,899
For brevity, they are both referred to as Calculus.

10
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:20,919
Differentiation, which is 'differentiation' or 'differential calculus', and Integration, which is 'integration' or 'integral calculus'.

11
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:28,119
Before we leave this point, there's also a small note I want to mention.

12
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:39,099
Many people think that you must study differentiation first to study integration, and that integration is built upon differentiation. And this is not entirely correct.

13
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,709
You can normally study integration before differentiation. There is a relationship... the two are considered two sides of the same coin.

14
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:50,739
And in a specific example like this, they are considered opposites of each other.

15
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:54,999
But it's not necessary to study this one first and then study that one.

16
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:05,029
Mostly, in most courses, including the course we will work on today, or rather, that I will work on in this course, God willing, we will study differentiation and then integration, but this is not a requirement.

17
00:02:05,029 --> 00:02:11,419
In fact, one of the two who invented Calculus published integration first, before... before differentiation.

18
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:21,049
And I believe in the 100-200 years after the invention of Calculus, most books discussed the two separately. You would pick up a book for integration and then pick up a book for differentiation, and there was no problem with that at all.

19
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:23,799
I just wanted to clarify this point initially.

20
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:24,349
Okay.

21
00:02:25,649 --> 00:02:26,619
What does Calculus mean?

22
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:43,599
Many people enter a stage like this in the course, and they come and draw a graph for you and tell you that Calculus is the rate of change, and that it's the slope of the tangent line at a point on a curve, or that integration is the area under the curve or part of the curve.

23
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:55,999
And if they want to delve deeper into the topic, they'll give you the example of velocity, the change of distance over time, and acceleration, which is the change of velocity over time, and so on.

24
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:11,019
I feel that this discussion is a bit early. Meaning, you can't jump into this topic at a stage like this. If we were to give an example, it should be more profound and simpler to understand, so we know what Calculus is talking about.

25
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:25,339
Honestly, the example of... or rather, the definition of Calculus within the framework I just mentioned a moment ago, I see it as not very precise, because these, frankly, are the tools or what Calculus does.

26
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:30,959
But the specific problem that Calculus addresses, this is what we need to talk about a bit.

27
00:03:31,249 --> 00:03:31,549
Okay.

28
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:41,149
I will say one sentence about Calculus before moving on to the historical part that explains to us the circumstances of the emergence of Calculus.

29
00:03:41,929 --> 00:03:50,859
If I wanted to give a definition for Calculus, I could say, I personally call it, the art of dealing with narrow spaces.

30
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,989
Keep this sentence in your mind for now, it will become clear later.

31
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:06,609
When we mention the word Calculus, two names appear immediately: Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz.

32
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:09,269
Isaac Newton is more famous than fire on a flagstaff (very famous).

33
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:24,539
An English scientist, the king of gravity for at least 200 years, Newton's laws, he had achievements in optics and many other things, and he is the one who invented Calculus.

34
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:29,289
Leibniz is less famous than him, although he is also a heavyweight scientist.

35
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:37,059
He was originally a German scientist, studied law in Germany, and then moved to France. He studied Calculus... studied mathematics a bit, liked it, and continued with it.

36
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:39,679
And then he invented Calculus for us too.

37
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:53,819
Well, honestly, he didn't just invent Calculus, he also had achievements in many other things, among them is that he invented the binary system of 0s and 1s that we use today in computer systems. This was in the second half of the 17th century.

38
00:04:55,829 --> 00:05:00,179
The question here is, what makes two scientists invent Calculus at the same time?

39
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:00,179
Of course,

40
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:17,419
when Leibniz and Newton started publishing their work on Calculus, Europe, in every sense of the word, before Calculus, or before Leibniz and Newton started talking about their achievements in Calculus, was one thing, and after Calculus, it was something else.

41
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:22,909
I personally almost assert that Europe's real renaissance began with Calculus.

42
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:32,569
Calculus, without any exaggeration, is the foundation of modern science that you see around you today in this form.

43
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:39,479
Without Calculus, you actually go back with technology to roughly the beginning of the 18th century.

44
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:56,839
So, Calculus is one of the important topics, it must be studied deeply, because any career you want to pursue, whether in physics, engineering, or any kind of science, even including advanced things in mathematics, Calculus is what holds this whole thing together.

45
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:07,209
Something of this importance, when someone like Newton and someone like Leibniz come and say we invented Calculus, Europe and the scientific community within it stood up on its feet.

46
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:14,369
And a big fight ensued between the two over who among them had the right to claim they invented Calculus.

47
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:26,419
Newton would say "I did it," Leibniz would say "No, I did it." And a huge debate occurred in the scientific circles in Europe for tens of years, even after the death of Leibniz and Newton, to say who really invented Calculus.

48
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:35,549
And historians settled on the conclusion that Newton and Leibniz invented Calculus independently, meaning separately.

49
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:44,959
And of course, there was much evidence for this claim. One of them was the difference in timing and the notes they were writing.

50
00:06:45,469 --> 00:07:00,359
And the more important difference, or rather, the more important point that supported the idea that they both did it separately, is that the two of them, despite reaching the same result in the end in Calculus, the approach of each one of them was completely different.

51
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,859
Newton and Leibniz looked at Calculus from two completely different perspectives.

52
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,039
And this is an important point you need to be aware of.

53
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:22,249
Because sometimes when we talk about Calculus, we look at it from a very narrow perspective, which is the rate of change. Of course, the rate of change is the most important thing, but we take it as if it's only in physics and that it fixes velocity and acceleration, and that's the end of the story.

54
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:28,809
Calculus is actually very important, for example, you'd be surprised that Calculus is used very heavily in finance and economics.

55
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,709
So, Calculus is much broader than the narrow perspective we sometimes confine ourselves to.

56
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:38,049
Let's return to the more important question.

57
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:49,809
What makes someone like Newton and someone like Leibniz, living in different countries, think about something as important as this, like Calculus, and roughly at the same time?

58
00:07:51,399 --> 00:08:02,059
Calculus wasn't a luxury, meaning Newton and Leibniz weren't just sitting around idly and said, "Let's invent something new," so they made Calculus. No. And this is a very important point you need to be aware of.

59
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:14,799
Calculus was a cure for a problem that already existed. And this problem grew and reached a stage where the sciences, especially physics, became stuck, unable to move forward.

60
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:18,899
The problem itself has existed perhaps for thousands of years.

61
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:28,959
To understand this problem, let's go back to the example I wanted to mention, which I told you about earlier and said we wanted to talk about, which is an example considered very fundamental in explaining what the problem of Calculus is.

62
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:31,909
This example dates back to the time of the Greeks.

63
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:40,519
Specifically, Archimedes. Of course, we know the Greeks were obsessed with geometry. Geometry, for them, wasn't just a part of mathematics, it was practically their life in geometry.

64
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,089
So, Archimedes was trying to calculate the area of a circle.

65
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:50,249
Of course, when I tell you Archimedes was trying to calculate the area of a circle, I am greatly simplifying what Archimedes was doing.

66
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:57,619
Archimedes was actually trying to find the closest value for pi, to calculate the area of the circle and its circumference.

67
00:08:57,619 --> 00:09:00,689
But for simplicity, we'll say he wanted to calculate the area of the circle.

68
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:15,409
And also for simplicity, we won't delve into the entire approach he took, because his approach was large and had many details. We'll just take a specific part of it to lead us to the problem he faced, and which later Newton and Leibniz solved with Calculus.

69
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:37,439
To make this point clear, let's go to the computer and see the model in GeoGebra, what it looks like, and try to solve the problem that... or try to represent what Archimedes did around 200 BC.

70
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:42,909
Okay. This is the circle in front of us that we'll work on.

71
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:48,599
And we want to see what Archimedes did to calculate its area.

72
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:55,699
Archimedes couldn't, or didn't have a way to calculate the area of the circle in the traditional way, because it's a curve.

73
00:09:56,579 --> 00:10:06,359
They could calculate the area and perimeter of shapes made up of straight lines, like triangles, squares, rectangles, polygons, and so on.

74
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:17,369
So he said, okay, let's put a shape made of these straight lines, whose area we can calculate, and put it inside the circle such that it occupies the largest possible area, and thus, this would be approximately the area of the circle.

75
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:23,419
So he came and put a hexagon, or a polygon with six sides.

76
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:28,959
Of course, why did he start with six sides, or the hexagon? Because the hexagon has important symmetry.

77
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:38,309
Every side of the sides you see in front of you from the hexagon equals the radius of the circle that circumscribes it from the six vertices.

78
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:41,029
So this is something that distinguishes the hexagon,

79
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:49,069
that's why he started from this part, because it provided him with very important information that facilitated the proof he was working on.

80
00:10:49,069 --> 00:11:00,989
As we said, there are many details in the work Archimedes did in calculating pi or the circumference or the area of the circle, which we won't discuss. I'm just interested in a specific point in illustrating the problem that Calculus tries to solve.

81
01:01,969 --> 01:09,389
Okay. If we look at the green hexagon, it occupies a considerable area of the circle. We still have some small things here, which are the white parts.

82
01:10,149 --> 01:17,949
We can increase the accuracy of our reading for the area if we increase the number of sides of the polygon.

83
01:18,519 --> 01:26,659
So we started with six, now we've increased it or put another polygon, making it 12 sides. And here we want to look at something.

84
01:27,689 --> 01:36,849
The first side, or the side of the hexagon when it had six sides, is longer than each side in the polygon when it had 12 sides.

85
01:38,549 --> 01:39,059
Okay.

86
01:41,949 --> 01:58,619
The point, or the distance between the two points, as a result of the side of the polygon becoming shorter, the distance between the two points became shorter. Instead of the distance between the two points looking like this, the distance between the two points decreased by approximately half, or specifically by half.

87
01:58,929 --> 02:01,439
Keep this in mind, we'll come back to it later.

88
02:02,319 --> 02:04,079
I still have a white part.

89
02:04,899 --> 02:12,269
True, the accuracy of my reading of the area increased, but I still have a white part here that I haven't covered.

90
02:12,749 --> 02:18,339
Okay. If I increased the number of sides of the polygon? I started with 6, now 12, let's make them 24.

91
02:19,069 --> 02:22,559
Ah, now it's clear that we've what? Finished almost the entire circle.

92
02:22,929 --> 02:24,359
But I said what? Approximately.

93
02:24,629 --> 02:30,459
Why? Because even though you might not notice it now, there are still white parts.

94
02:30,819 --> 02:38,119
And to see these white parts, if we zoom in, it might become clearer.

95
02:42,259 --> 02:54,089
You'll notice that here, the white distance here started to grow. And not just grow, I started to notice that these two points, after being very close to each other, moved apart.

96
02:54,429 --> 02:58,629
And this is a very important point. After I did the zoom in, the distance between the points grew.

97
02:59,439 --> 03:07,559
And I was able to show you that the white part here exists. No, there's a part of the circle we still couldn't calculate its area.

98
03:07,919 --> 03:13,779
Okay. If we increased the number of sides of the polygon again and made them 48?

99
03:14,429 --> 03:17,299
Ah, okay, now we've almost finished the what? Finished the circle entirely.

100
03:17,579 --> 03:23,749
But also, if you focus a bit here, you'll find that there's still a white area or distance here.

101
03:23,989 --> 03:37,649
And if we zoom in more, you'll notice that every time I zoom in, the distance... the two points move apart, I stretch them, and the white area or distance here becomes visible in front of me.

102
03:38,079 --> 03:40,619
And this is something extremely important.

103
03:40,919 --> 03:54,539
Okay, let's look at what we did. First, we put the hexagon, which has six sides, then we made them 12 sides, covering a larger area, then we made 48 sides, covering a larger area, and then we made... no, it was 6, 12, 24, and then 48.

104
03:55,119 --> 04:07,849
The conclusion here is what? It's clear that no matter how much we keep increasing the number of sides of the polygon, there will always be a part of the circle that we still can't cover with the area.

105
04:08,219 --> 04:18,279
Because the two points, any two points, no matter how close I bring them together, I can zoom in on them and show you that between them is a large area. We'll talk about this topic in detail later.

106
04:19,059 --> 04:31,929
The question here is, when does the length of this polygon, or the side of this polygon, cover the circle without there being a gap, without this white gap existing?

107
04:32,419 --> 04:45,889
The answer is when this point sticks to this point, such that the length of the side of the polygon is the point itself, it's just a point on the circle.

108
04:46,279 --> 04:50,269
The problem is that this, mathematically, is impossible.

109
04:50,829 --> 04:53,159
Why? Let's go to the board and see.

110
04:54,889 --> 04:58,079
I think now we understand what Archimedes was trying to do.

111
04:58,779 --> 05:09,819
And we understood that his problem was that always, no matter how many sides he added, he would have a side that creates a gap between it and the circle, because the circle is a curve and the side is a straight line.

112
05:10,269 --> 05:22,719
And we said that it's impossible for this side to stick to the circle and eliminate all the gap to calculate it, except when this point sticks to this point.

113
05:24,789 --> 05:31,849
The problem is that for this to happen, we need to understand how real numbers work.

114
05:32,629 --> 05:34,849
Because here there is a contradiction.

115
05:35,199 --> 05:41,819
If we look at the number line, let's talk about natural numbers first. Let's say here is 0, here is 1, here is 2, and here is 3.

116
05:42,269 --> 05:44,739
And we are talking here about natural numbers.

117
05:45,999 --> 05:58,139
If I came and asked you, what are the numbers between 1 and 3? You would say what? You would say 2. And your answer would be 100% correct, because natural numbers only contain whole positive numbers.

118
05:59,869 --> 06:04,099
In this situation, we are not dealing with natural numbers.

119
06:04,599 --> 06:08,709
We are dealing with the set of real numbers.

120
06:09,649 --> 06:12,049
And the set of real numbers is different from natural numbers.

121
06:12,519 --> 06:26,959
Because the set of real numbers, if I asked you what are the real numbers between 1 and 3? You'd say 2, and 1.5, and 2.5, and 2 and 3/4, and 2.999999... It's infinity.

122
06:27,509 --> 06:31,019
The number of numbers between 1 and 3 is infinity.

123
06:31,559 --> 06:33,909
The number of numbers between 1 and 2 is infinity.

124
06:34,229 --> 06:42,829
The number of numbers between any two numbers, no matter how small the distance between them is on the real number line, is infinity.

125
06:43,259 --> 06:54,069
Any two points you might place, I can zoom in like I was doing for you in the program earlier, and show you an infinite number of numbers between them, no matter how small the distance between them was originally.

126
06:55,389 --> 06:56,559
Same problem here.

127
06:56,889 --> 07:09,159
For me to connect this point to this point, such that the length of this side is the distance between two points on the circle, and there's nothing between these two points, this is impossible because there are no two points in the real numbers that don't have something between them.

128
07:12,829 --> 07:14,489
And this was the dilemma.

129
07:15,089 --> 07:16,029
This is Calculus.

130
07:17,279 --> 07:29,569
So Archimedes imagined something and gave it a name back then, it's not the name we will use later, but he imagined that there is a number very, very, very, very small, but not zero.

131
07:30,679 --> 07:33,649
And this concept, we will return to it later, but keep this idea in your mind.

132
07:34,479 --> 07:40,459
This problem existed long ago, since the time, as we said, of Archimedes, and it remained with scientists for a long time.

133
07:40,459 --> 07:47,329
When did serious work happen to solve... or in an attempt to solve this problem?

134
07:47,329 --> 07:49,729
This was in the first half of the 17th century.

135
07:50,549 --> 07:57,579
You have scientists like Kepler, Descartes, Fermat, Pascal, all these people tried to solve this problem.

136
07:57,899 --> 08:09,489
Specifically, they weren't trying to solve this problem exactly, they were trying to solve the problem we mentioned at the beginning of the video, which is the tangent line at a point on a curve, and the area under the curve.

137
08:10,639 --> 08:12,959
This problem is the same as this problem.

138
08:13,639 --> 08:16,119
How? That's what we'll see, God willing, in the course.

139
08:17,469 --> 08:37,789
Specifically, this problem, or solving something like this, is easy if I can manage this problem, because the only obstacle preventing me from getting the tangent line and the area under the curve is reaching the point or, rather, the distance between two points such that there is nothing between them. And the real numbers don't allow me to do something like that.

140
08:39,259 --> 08:41,879
As we said, many scientists tried this topic,

141
08:43,069 --> 08:44,999
and some of their techniques worked.

142
08:45,489 --> 08:57,129
Their problem was that they were somewhat isolated, meaning this technique works for this graph, but doesn't work for another graph, or it works for this type of problem but doesn't work for other problems, or it produces errors in this case and doesn't produce errors in other cases.

143
08:57,129 --> 09:02,979
So the matter wasn't consistent, it couldn't be generalized and become something that works for all graphs.

144
09:03,829 --> 09:07,949
And here is the achievement made by Newton and Leibniz.

145
09:08,439 --> 09:18,239
Newton and Leibniz sat down, studied the experiments done by those before them very carefully and very focusedly, and they learned from all the mistakes they made.

146
09:18,579 --> 09:24,989
And they gathered all this and came up with the technique which is Calculus, specifically Integration and Differentiation.

147
09:25,739 --> 09:30,819
Their problem was that the foundation supporting them wasn't strong. The tool was working.

148
09:31,259 --> 09:38,229
Indeed, it caused a revolution in the scientific community in Europe, because truly, without this, physics... physics was stuck.

149
09:38,519 --> 09:50,099
Because all the modern problems of physics depend on the rate of change, depend on irregular shapes. Traditional mathematics like arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry

150
09:52,369 --> 09:56,739
cannot solve the real problems found in the real world.

151
09:56,739 --> 09:58,909
So physics had indeed reached a point where it was stuck.

152
09:59,509 --> 10:02,519
So Calculus was the only solution, and that's why I always say that

153
10:03,659 --> 10:18,959
if Newton and Leibniz hadn't invented it, someone else would have. One of the scientists who was working on these things would have eventually reached a solution, because physics wouldn't have progressed further... further than... I mean, it wouldn't have advanced if Calculus hadn't appeared.

154
10:20,769 --> 10:32,919
As we said, Newton and Leibniz created the technique, but the foundation supporting the technique, from the perspective of mathematical fundamentals and mathematical reasoning, was very weak, because they couldn't find a solution to this problem.

155
10:33,299 --> 10:37,979
In the end, they kind of faked it. And specifically Leibniz, they made a shortcut.

156
10:38,279 --> 10:38,809
They said what?

157
10:39,889 --> 11:01,699
They said, "We don't know how to... we can't solve this issue," so they came and invented a new term for you called... well, it's not a new term, they took the same idea from Archimedes but gave it a fancier name, called Infinitesimal Numbers or Quantities.

158
11:02,479 --> 11:03,519
What do they mean?

159
11:03,769 --> 11:18,069
These folks say that there is a number very, very, very small, smaller than anything you can imagine, and smaller than anything you can measure, but it is greater than zero. It's still in the positive numbers.

160
11:19,109 --> 11:20,429
What is this number? We don't know.

161
11:21,679 --> 11:22,369
It exists.

162
11:23,249 --> 11:28,359
And this was the problem with the Calculus of Newton and Leibniz.

163
11:29,599 --> 11:46,519
Of course, all mathematicians and philosophers who existed at that time criticized this concept because there's nothing to say about it, there's nothing... you're not holding onto anything tangible. You can't build an important branch of mathematics on a strange concept like this.

164
11:47,269 --> 11:52,289
But Calculus was working. You take the equations of Calculus, apply them, it works perfectly.

165
11:52,659 --> 11:54,839
But the foundation had a major problem.

166
11:54,839 --> 12:08,659
It had such a big problem that there was a famous person named Berkeley, who, around... he wrote an article after the death of Newton and Leibniz by about 10 or 20, maybe even 30 years, criticizing the foundation of Calculus very strongly. It was perhaps one of the most scathing critiques of the foundation of Calculus.

167
12:10,799 --> 12:18,989
And he described the infinitesimal numbers, he called them "the ghosts of departed quantities."

168
12:19,399 --> 12:29,199
In short, he wanted to say what? That Newton and Leibniz are talking about a number that died, and now we are dealing with its ghost. Or, I mean, that's exactly what he meant.

169
12:29,199 --> 12:31,869
So, of course, there was a big problem with the topic.

170
12:31,869 --> 12:38,969
This problem was solved later. We'll come to that topic after a little while.

171
12:38,969 --> 12:53,039
In the late 17th century and early 18th century, or in the first half of the 18th century, another group of scientists appeared who contributed to the development of Calculus and the development of mathematics in general, but I'm interested in three of them here: Taylor, Euler, and Fourier.

172
12:54,719 --> 13:12,719
These three had contributions in mathematics in general, but the three of them had a common factor: they were masters in two areas, which are Sequences and Series.

173
13:13,349 --> 13:22,799
Of course, sequences and series as concepts aren't new, meaning they didn't appear in the 17th or 18th century, but they existed since the time of Fibonacci, things like that maybe 300-400 years before. So the concept is old.

174
13:23,799 --> 13:31,939
But with the emergence of Calculus, they started looking at sequences and series differently, and they started talking more deeply about infinite series.

175
13:32,609 --> 13:39,599
And this led to the emergence of another concept later, which we will talk about, that corrected the issue of infinitesimal numbers.

176
13:41,689 --> 13:44,889
And here comes the role of the scientist after him, whose name is Cauchy.

177
13:44,889 --> 13:54,929
He was a French scientist, who was in the late 18th century and early 19th century, or the first half of the 19th century.

178
13:56,099 --> 14:04,639
Cauchy was the first one to introduce the concept... let's put it here now because this is its place... the concept of Limits.

179
14:04,639 --> 14:05,979
And let's put this in a box.

180
14:06,599 --> 14:10,479
Limits are the foundation upon which Calculus rests.

181
14:10,939 --> 14:14,419
Limits are the concept that replaced infinitesimal numbers.

182
14:15,019 --> 14:31,829
And Limits were formed after a major development in mathematics, and one of the most important things that contributed to Cauchy being able to grasp the concept of limits and present it was sequences and series. That's why I mentioned it. It's one of the very important things in Calculus because it strongly affects the understanding of limits.

183
14:32,459 --> 14:42,639
Cauchy was the first one to introduce or talk about the concept of limits. After more than 130 years since the Calculus made by Newton and Leibniz.

184
14:43,379 --> 14:53,109
To the extent that some people consider Cauchy the true inventor or the true discoverer of Calculus because he introduced the concept of limits. Because for many people, Limits are Calculus.

185
14:53,639 --> 15:01,229
Differentiation and integration are just the tools you use to solve physics problems or mathematical problems you have. But the concept,

186
15:01,689 --> 15:10,619
the foundation, the mathematical reasoning behind Calculus lies almost exclusively in Limits.

187
15:11,319 --> 15:19,059
Understanding Limits is not easy. Understanding Limits requires work from you, because if you understand it, the rest will be a piece of cake.

188
15:20,169 --> 15:38,389
Infinitesimal numbers started to shake, until someone came after Cauchy, a German scientist, who refined Limits, because Cauchy's Limits had some... يعني... ambiguity, so he refined them, and that was the last nail in the coffin of infinitesimal numbers, and Limits, after that, took off.

189
15:41,809 --> 15:46,129
Limits were trying specifically to address this problem.

190
15:46,589 --> 15:49,869
And indeed, they addressed it to a very, very, very large extent.

191
15:51,039 --> 16:09,369
After this, a bit later, in the late 18th century... no, sorry. In the late 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, or, I mean, the first period of the 20th century, another scientist appeared.

192
16:10,839 --> 16:14,829
And this man, in particular, I must write his name.

193
16:14,829 --> 16:21,309
This man's name is George Cantor.

194
16:23,139 --> 16:29,079
George Cantor, if a movie hasn't been made about his life yet, one must be made about him.

195
16:29,809 --> 16:41,259
This man's life story was tragic, it was very exciting and sad, and unfortunately, quite unfortunate.

196
16:42,429 --> 16:47,269
This man started talking about very important theories in this area.

197
16:47,269 --> 16:49,689
This man, in short, is the master of real numbers.

198
16:50,339 --> 16:53,929
He didn't talk about limits specifically, or rather, his contributions weren't specifically in limits.

199
16:53,929 --> 17:05,429
His contributions were in changing the perspective of mathematicians towards numbers, and specifically real numbers, which directly affects people's understanding of limits.

200
17:07,149 --> 17:15,889
This man introduced Set Theory, Number Theory, the Continuum, Cardinality, the Cardinality of the Continuum, Nested Intervals...

201
17:16,519 --> 17:26,399
The number of theorems this man created, he introduced practically a new chapter in mathematics, which we now, almost all of it falls under the name Set Theory.

202
17:27,599 --> 17:36,929
The problem is that when he introduced these concepts initially, nobody paid attention to him.

203
17:37,309 --> 17:45,939
Despite him being a renowned scientist, I mean, he was originally a German scientist but was born in Russia and returned to Germany later, and studied mathematics in famous German universities.

204
17:46,349 --> 17:50,939
But when he started talking about Set Theory and such things, nobody paid attention to him.

205
17:51,809 --> 18:10,549
Not only that, but they started attacking him to a degree that was somewhat insulting, and they stalled his career at many stages because, for example, he had an opportunity to take a prestigious position, say at the University of Berlin, his professor, who didn't agree with his theories, blocked him. His professor was one of the people who most negatively impacted his life.

206
18:10,549 --> 18:25,969
He even called him the... I think he called him "the corruptor of the youth," something like that, meaning, in short, he wanted to say he was a spoiled young man and corrupting the youth around him because he was teaching these techniques to his colleagues, or rather, his peers in Karrl Mathematics.

207
18:27,139 --> 18:38,779
The man... the situation became so bad for him that he fell into depression, entered into depression, and spent the last 15 or 20 years of his life moving from one mental institution to another.

208
18:38,779 --> 18:41,769
Yes, people complicated the man's life.

209
18:42,769 --> 19:13,149
And his son died during that period, and his condition worsened. He would go in and out [of institutions], work a little, they would mess things up for him more, he'd go back to the hospital, come out... المهم, in the end, it reached a stage where he gave up mathematics and went to study philosophy, and then he left philosophy and started teaching literature, specializing in the literature of the Shakespearean era and Queen Elizabeth and stuff. And then he returned to mathematics. المهم, in the end, the man kept going in and out of mental institutions until he died in the last one he entered, he entered about four or five times, and died in 1918 in the last mental institution he entered.

210
19:14,839 --> 19:21,959
Towards the end of his life, people started realizing that this man wasn't crazy. This man was talking about very important things.

211
19:22,509 --> 19:34,589
And today, one of the most important branches of mathematics, and one of the branches of mathematics considered very advanced, are the theories this man practically founded.

212
19:35,129 --> 19:40,309
Why are we saying this? Because this man changed people's concept of real numbers.

213
19:40,879 --> 19:48,829
And as long as you change your concept of real numbers, then you change your concept of limits. And to understand limits correctly,

214
19:48,829 --> 20:02,309
you must understand the next point, which is the Properties of Numbers in general.

215
20:03,709 --> 20:07,499
This is our course.

216
20:08,139 --> 20:12,109
We'll talk initially about the properties of numbers,

217
20:12,499 --> 20:14,309
then we'll talk about functions.

218
20:14,309 --> 20:19,939
Of course, functions are the most important concept in mathematics generally. So we'll talk about functions... where should I write it? Write it here.

219
20:21,059 --> 20:22,659
Functions.

220
20:24,029 --> 20:30,179
So we'll talk here, get into functions, and from functions, we get into limits, and from limits, we get into differentiation and integration.

221
20:30,649 --> 20:33,809
Sequences and series will be in different places throughout the course.

222
20:33,989 --> 20:41,159
We'll talk about complex numbers, which are also related to the properties of numbers,

223
20:42,459 --> 20:45,159
because they introduce us to a new type of numbers.

224
20:46,559 --> 21:06,469
So, the purpose of this introduction was to show you that Calculus is not just differentiation and integration, and not just limits, it's many things together, because Calculus as a topic is part of a larger branch in mathematics called Real Analysis.

225
21:07,619 --> 21:30,379
And this is one of the important fields in mathematics. We don't necessarily need to go into it, but at the very least, we must understand this framework well if you want to have a strong future in any study in physics, and any study in engineering, or, of course, consequently, in any advanced mathematics you'll work on, God willing, in the future.

226
21:31,429 --> 21:34,609
Now for the source we will use... work from in this course.

227
21:34,609 --> 21:35,889
There are, of course, many books.

228
21:36,219 --> 21:44,529
The most famous book considered as an introduction to Calculus and Real Analysis is a book by an American scientist named Michael Spivak.

229
21:44,899 --> 22:08,819
I believe the man is still alive, he was born in 1940. He wrote the book we will work from, or the first edition of it, or the first version of it was in '67, meaning he was 27 years old. This is the year he got his PhD. Despite him writing the book when he was very young, as I told you, this book is considered *the* Calculus book for many people. Meaning, they consider that to study Calculus, you must read this book at some stage... or in any stage of your life, so that you can say you've studied Calculus.

230
22:09,129 --> 22:11,539
This is the book we will work from, God willing.

231
22:12,869 --> 22:15,829
See you in the next video. Peace be upon you.
