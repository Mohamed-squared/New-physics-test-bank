00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:20,587
Hello.

2
00:00:21,617 --> 00:00:26,387
In the previous videos, we talked about the
properties of numbers, which are properties 1 to 12.

3
00:00:26,857 --> 00:00:32,547
And we agreed that any dealing we have with numbers
must happen within the framework of these 12 properties.

4
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:39,177
In this video, or at the end of this video, God willing,
we will start to discover that these 12 properties have shortcomings.

5
00:00:39,177 --> 00:00:45,827
There are some situations and some things related to numbers
that these properties fail to explain.

6
00:00:46,277 --> 00:00:51,487
And we must find another way
to deal with these situations.

7
00:00:52,697 --> 00:01:01,937
Okay, until the last video, we were talking about
numbers in a somewhat loose way, meaning we weren't
very precise about the type of numbers we were discussing.

8
00:01:02,577 --> 00:01:08,617
In this video, God willing, or specifically from the beginning
of this video, God willing, we need to be a bit careful in our dealings with numbers.

9
00:01:08,617 --> 00:01:12,447
Meaning, when we talk about numbers, we need to know
which type of numbers we are talking about.

10
00:01:13,257 --> 00:01:14,947
Why? We'll see in a bit.

11
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:22,887
The first type we have of numbers is what we call
the Natural Numbers, and we denote it with the heavy N, like this.

12
00:01:23,697 --> 00:01:29,117
We call them the Natural Numbers.

13
00:01:30,577 --> 00:01:34,027
Or the Counting Numbers.

14
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:39,827
And from its name, it's clear. We call them Natural Numbers or
Counting Numbers because these are the numbers we intuitively use for counting.

15
00:01:39,827 --> 00:01:44,077
When I give you something like this and ask how many,
you say one, two, three.

16
00:01:44,657 --> 00:01:51,357
So, if we wanted to represent this on the number line,
we'd find that we put them, for example, like this.

17
00:01:51,617 --> 00:01:56,007
We say here 1, 2, 3, to infinity.

18
00:01:56,407 --> 00:02:01,987
Therefore, the Natural Numbers are the positive numbers
from 1 to infinity. This is straightforward.

19
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:10,907
Before we move to the second type of numbers, let's see
the relationship between the Properties of Numbers and the Natural Numbers.

20
00:02:11,137 --> 00:02:18,607
If we look at the Natural Numbers, we'll find that out of the 12 properties
we talked about, at least three of them don't work with Natural Numbers.

21
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:25,297
These are the second property, the third, and the seventh.

22
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:33,107
The second property stated that A + 0 = A. This was the identity.

23
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:44,017
And the third property stated that A + (-A) = 0. This is the inverse
of addition. And the inverse of multiplication,

24
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:49,737
which is A * A^(-1), which means A^(-1) is 1/A.

25
00:02:51,657 --> 00:02:54,147
These three properties don't work with Natural Numbers. Why?

26
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:56,937
The first one involves zero, and there are no zeros here.

27
00:02:57,357 --> 00:02:58,657
Negative, there are no negatives.

28
00:02:59,217 --> 00:03:02,647
Quotient, 1/A, there are no fractions here.

29
00:03:02,787 --> 00:03:04,277
Therefore, these three properties...

30
00:03:04,277 --> 00:03:14,597
Of course, property 10, because it's a combination of some of these,
but I, you know, removed it. There's no need for us to talk about it now,
as it's implicitly clear from the same properties because it shares them.

31
00:03:15,397 --> 00:03:18,387
So, these three properties, at least, don't work with Natural Numbers.

32
00:03:19,237 --> 00:03:28,217
Okay, at some stage in human history, we needed zero.
Regardless of why and when and all that, the point is, there's a number we added called zero.

33
00:03:30,637 --> 00:03:34,277
The Natural Numbers together with zero are called the Whole Numbers.

34
00:03:34,277 --> 00:03:48,007
By the way, the 'W' is not a formal symbol. I mean, the 'N' is formal,
a symbol in mathematics officially representing Natural Numbers.
Whole Numbers don't have... don't have an agreed-upon symbol,

35
00:03:48,007 --> 00:03:53,417
but some people write it as 'W', so I'll write it to represent it,
but know that this is not quite formal.

36
00:03:55,167 --> 00:04:02,057
Okay, the Whole Numbers, by adding zero to them,
solved the problem of... let me put it in another color...

37
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:06,127
solved the problem, or rather, the second property applies to them
because there is a zero here. Okay, that's good.

38
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:09,777
But properties three and seven still don't work.

39
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:12,137
There's a note here I want to mention quickly.

40
00:04:13,147 --> 00:04:20,237
Some sciences, specifically, especially in computer science,
consider zero a natural number. Why?

41
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:27,747
Because in computer science and in most programming languages
- this is due to many reasons we don't want to get into details of -
counting starts from zero.

42
00:04:28,617 --> 00:04:36,787
Based on that, they consider zero to be a natural number for them.
But in mainstream mathematics, zero is not a natural number.

43
00:04:36,787 --> 00:04:42,377
When you don't have anything in front of you to count,
you don't say zero, one, two, three.

44
00:04:42,377 --> 00:04:47,867
When I give you the numbers... I mean, I tell you, for example, count these pens,
you don't tell me zero, one, two, three. No, you start counting from one.

45
00:04:48,977 --> 00:04:55,717
So, this is just a point I wanted to clarify so that if you read in some sources
that zero is a natural number, you know where this idea comes from.

46
00:04:57,927 --> 00:04:58,557
Okay?

47
00:04:59,227 --> 00:05:08,017
We have... let's expand the numbers a bit.
Let's go into the negatives: -1, -2, and so on to infinity in the negative direction.

48
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:13,287
And these, we call them the Integers.

49
00:05:15,737 --> 00:05:28,257
The question here is, where does this 'Z' come from? Why do we denote integers
with the letter Z? Because Z comes from the word "Zahl".
Let me put it in brackets, it ends with L. I don't know if I'm pronouncing it correctly or not. It's Z-A-H-L.

50
00:05:28,257 --> 00:05:33,637
It's actually a German word, German, and it means "number"
(specifically the whole numbers or integer count), and the Z comes from that.

51
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:44,167
Of course, it's clear that the Whole Numbers... sorry, the Integers
solved for me the problem, or solved the third property.

52
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:46,757
Because now there are negatives.

53
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:47,817
Okay.

54
00:05:51,057 --> 00:05:52,807
Then we said we have fractions.

55
00:05:53,257 --> 00:06:02,927
By the way, what I'm saying now is not the historical order of discovering numbers.
No, I just mean the order I'm explaining is aligned with the properties, nothing more.

56
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:11,817
But of course, fractions were known even before zero in some civilizations.
So the order here is not meant to be the chronological order of discovering these numbers.

57
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:13,097
Okay.

58
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:23,187
Here, for example, we say 1.5, or we can represent it as 3/2.
Here, for example, 0.5, we represent it, for example, as 1/2.

59
00:06:23,947 --> 00:06:33,847
What we just mentioned, they are called fractions or quotients,
and this is the last type I have in numbers, in... I mean, not the very last,
but the last in this part. We call them Quotients.

60
00:06:37,587 --> 00:06:43,237
Or the Rational Numbers.

61
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:45,617
We'll get to the "rational" part in a bit.

62
00:06:46,637 --> 00:06:51,787
There are a few things here that are very important
about quotients that we need to be aware of.

63
00:06:53,137 --> 00:06:57,447
First thing, quotients are not just the fractions between integers.

64
00:06:57,447 --> 00:07:01,007
No, the integers themselves, including zero, are considered quotients.

65
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:06,877
What is a quotient? A quotient is any number
that you can put in the form of a ratio.

66
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:09,607
And hence the word "rational," which comes from "ratio."

67
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:15,577
Therefore, 1.5, you can put it as 3/2. 0.5 is 1/2.

68
00:07:15,887 --> 00:07:17,957
2, you can put it as 2/1.

69
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:23,027
Zero is 0/3. -2 is -2/1.

70
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:29,747
Therefore, everything you see on the number line is a quotient,
because it can be put in the rational form.

71
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,557
This is the first point.

72
00:07:32,497 --> 00:07:42,277
The second point, there are numbers that are repeating decimals.
For example, like 0.3333 and so on. Of course, you can write this like this.

73
00:07:42,527 --> 00:07:44,937
Is this number rational or not rational?

74
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:51,847
It is rational. Regardless of the fact that it's a repeating decimal
and its decimal part doesn't end, it keeps going on here to infinity,

75
00:07:52,277 --> 00:07:55,437
but it is rational. Why? Because I can put it in this form.

76
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,927
1/3, when you divide 1 by 3, you get this form.

77
00:07:58,927 --> 00:08:07,917
You get a repeating decimal like this. Therefore, a number like this
is considered rational because it can be put in the form of the quotient.

78
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:11,247
Keep this part in mind because I'll need it later.

79
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:18,647
Okay, it's clear, of course, that the rational numbers or quotients
solved this problem for me because here I started dealing with fractions.

80
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:20,407
This is great.

81
00:08:22,237 --> 00:08:27,507
At this stage, you might say, where's the problem? There's no problem.
I have... we're done. Here, the number line is complete.

82
00:08:27,877 --> 00:08:39,217
I have four types of numbers to which... of course, the rest of the properties
already work starting from the Natural Numbers. We just had a problem with these three.
We solved them with the three new types of numbers, and it seems clear, we're done. The properties work.

83
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:45,167
But in reality, there is a situation that messed up this whole thing for me.

84
00:08:45,937 --> 00:08:48,967
There's a certain type of number that started causing problems.

85
00:08:49,907 --> 00:08:53,757
Like what, for example? Like... no, these need to be put in another color.

86
00:08:53,997 --> 00:08:55,347
Like who, for example?

87
00:08:57,367 --> 00:08:58,247
Pi (π).

88
00:08:59,587 --> 00:09:00,547
And Tau (τ).

89
00:09:00,817 --> 00:09:08,647
Let me put Tau for you, I mean, we might talk about it later, God willing.
They are... Tau, which is... Pi * 2.

90
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:15,197
And e, and the Golden Ratio (φ), and the square root of 2 (√2).

91
00:09:15,977 --> 00:09:23,927
The numbers we see before us here, all of them,
cannot be put in the quotient form.

92
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,017
Therefore, they are not rational.

93
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:35,887
And because they weren't rational, they couldn't find a name for them
other than Irrational.

94
00:09:37,207 --> 00:09:38,487
What does this mean?

95
00:09:38,747 --> 00:09:43,717
It means these numbers - and these are not the only ones,
there are many, infinitely many -

96
00:09:44,927 --> 00:09:47,937
cannot be put in this form.

97
00:09:48,447 --> 00:09:49,207
Why?

98
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:54,227
Because they are non-repeating decimals,
meaning there's no pattern that repeats.

99
00:09:54,567 --> 00:59:58,977
For example, if you look at 1/3, it has 0.3... 3333 repeats.

100
00:59:58,977 --> 01:04,807
There are other numbers, for instance, you might have 213, 213, 213.

101
01:04,807 --> 01:09,967
As long as there's a pattern, no matter how many digits are in the pattern,
that repeats, then it's rational. I can represent it as a quotient.

102
01:10,867 --> 01:21,997
The problem with these gentlemen here is that they are fractions,
or rather decimals, not integers, and they are non-repeating decimals,
but they have no pattern.

103
01:22,387 --> 01:23,987
Meaning, let's take √2 for example, it's the easiest.

104
01:24,557 --> 01:36,017
If we look at it, for example, I have it written here on the margin,
the value of √2, when you represent it, you'll find it's
1.414213562...

105
01:36,387 --> 01:43,987
These do not have any kind of pattern, and they keep going on like this
to infinity with strange, jumbled numbers.

106
01:43,987 --> 01:44,957
Nothing repeats.

107
01:44,957 --> 01:56,167
And that's why √2 cannot be represented... neither it, nor e, nor Pi, nor Tau,
nor the Golden Ratio, nor many numbers considered irrational numbers...
they cannot be represented in the form of a ratio. Therefore, we call them irrational,

108
01:56,727 --> 01:59,777
the opposite of rational, which means ratio.

109
02:02,177 --> 02:02,537
Okay.

110
02:03,337 --> 02:08,987
So that we are also... as we got used to, when we have something,
we need to see its proof. So let's prove...

111
02:09,457 --> 02:17,907
Of course, the proof for Pi and e, to prove they are irrational,
is a bit complicated. We'll talk about them, God willing, later in upcoming videos,

112
02:17,907 --> 02:22,217
the upcoming videos, in detail. But √2 is easy, we can finish it quickly.

113
02:22,567 --> 02:28,207
So, we will now do the proof that √2 is not rational, it is irrational.

114
02:29,417 --> 02:30,117
Okay.

115
02:30,817 --> 02:37,717
How do I prove that √2... let's even... let's work here...
that √2 is irrational?

116
02:37,967 --> 02:44,537
The method I will use in this proof... of course, there are about, say, 30 or 40 ways
you can prove that √2 is irrational.

117
02:44,787 --> 02:46,297
But we will only work through one example of them.

118
02:47,037 --> 02:55,707
This example uses a proof technique called Proof by Contradiction.

119
02:56,847 --> 02:58,217
Meaning, proof by contradiction.

120
02:58,477 --> 03:06,827
If you plan to have a career in mathematics, you need to pay attention to this part
because it's one of the very famous techniques in proofs in mathematics.

121
03:06,827 --> 03:08,007
What does this mean?

122
03:08,197 --> 03:11,697
It means you want to prove that √2, for example, is irrational.

123
03:12,737 --> 03:18,137
To prove it's irrational, the easiest way is to assume it is rational,

124
03:18,697 --> 03:22,737
and keep digging around it down there until you find a contradiction,
until you find a conflict.

125
03:22,737 --> 03:26,787
As soon as you find a contradiction with the assumption that it's rational,
it means it must be irrational.

126
03:27,217 --> 03:28,667
That's it, that's the whole thing simply.

127
03:28,667 --> 03:29,167
Okay.

128
03:29,877 --> 03:37,227
For the square root to be rational, it must be possible to put it in this form.

129
03:37,517 --> 03:43,707
Meaning, when you take the square root of a number like 2,
you get a number you can represent as an integer over an integer.

130
03:44,077 --> 03:44,527
Okay.

131
03:45,027 --> 03:51,307
And I will also assume that this integer... of course, I know this is not correct.
I want to prove now that this is not correct in a bit.

132
03:51,887 --> 03:58,097
There's another important thing I must mention about the fraction...
about the quotient before me.

133
03:58,097 --> 04:03,347
That the form before me is in its simplest form, meaning it's already
simplified to the end, meaning there is no...

134
04:03,837 --> 04:09,167
no common divisor or factor.

135
04:09,167 --> 04:17,467
Meaning, you can't simplify it further. For example, 2/4, no, this is not like that.
No, you simplify it first, put it as 1/2. So I'm assuming that the form before me

136
04:17,467 --> 04:24,397
is already simplified to its simplest possible form. Therefore,
there are no common factors between them. Okay.

137
04:25,837 --> 04:30,717
Let's continue working. Let's first get rid of the square root.

138
04:31,077 --> 04:32,117
So, this... let's put this here.

139
04:32,817 --> 04:39,307
Let's say it's (P/Q)² = 2. I squared it to get rid of the square root.

140
04:39,957 --> 04:44,587
From which, P²/Q² = 2.

141
04:45,737 --> 04:50,687
And from that, P² = 2 * Q². And here we pause for a moment.

142
04:53,767 --> 04:56,757
This P here is thus even.

143
04:57,617 --> 05:01,767
P is even.

144
05:02,517 --> 05:04,497
How did I know? From the 2 here.

145
05:05,137 --> 05:07,867
P² is equal to a number multiplied by 2.

146
05:08,427 --> 05:13,417
As long as this number is multiplied by 2, it means P² is divisible by 2.

147
05:13,957 --> 05:16,717
And since it's divisible by 2, it must be even. But that's P².

148
05:17,797 --> 05:22,647
Any square whose value is even, its root must have been even. Meaning, 16.

149
05:23,467 --> 05:28,167
16 was 4 squared. So 16 is even (square) and 4 is even (root).

150
05:28,387 --> 05:31,587
So, since P² is even, then P is even.

151
05:32,807 --> 05:37,477
And since P is even, then P can be written in the form... this form.

152
05:38,117 --> 05:44,687
= 2k. K is any number, multiplied by 2 gives me P.
So I assume P is equal to K multiplied by 2. Okay? Because it's even.

153
05:46,847 --> 05:52,157
I'll take this form and go back and put it into this equation.

154
05:54,387 --> 05:56,867
We'll replace P with 2k. So, (2k)²

155
05:58,787 --> 06:06,557
= 2 * Q².

156
06:07,517 --> 06:07,937
Okay.

157
06:08,847 --> 06:14,387
This means that 4k² = 2Q².

158
06:16,437 --> 06:21,997
Cancel the 2 with the 4 here, you're left with 2k² = Q².

159
06:22,847 --> 06:27,657
Q² equals a number multiplied by 2, so Q² is even.

160
06:28,277 --> 06:34,027
And since Q² is even, then Q is even.

161
06:37,057 --> 06:46,537
When I have P being even (an even number) and Q being even (an even number),
it means that there is at least one common divisor between them, which is 2.

162
06:47,547 --> 06:52,977
What does P being even mean? For example, P is 4, and this one is, say, 6. For example.

163
06:53,327 --> 06:55,867
So this is the quotient. Okay?

164
06:56,407 --> 07:03,237
This means that P can be simplified... I divide by 2, so this becomes 2,
and I divide 6 by 2, which gives me 3.

165
07:03,517 --> 07:19,127
This means that since both are even, there must be at least one common divisor
between them, which is 2. And this is my contradiction, because I assumed here from the beginning,
I started on the basis that they are already in the simplest form, there's no common divisor between them.

166
07:19,127 --> 07:20,277
And this is the proof by contradiction.

167
07:20,277 --> 07:27,787
I started by assuming that √2 equals a quotient, and when I followed this assumption,
I found a contradiction at the end.

168
07:28,177 --> 07:35,447
Therefore, this assumption is wrong. Consequently, this cannot possibly be true.

169
07:35,447 --> 07:37,937
And thus, √2 is an irrational number.

170
07:39,797 --> 07:40,307
Okay.

171
07:40,997 --> 07:42,907
The question here is, what's the problem with this?

172
07:42,907 --> 07:46,947
This thing in itself... of course, it's a big problem,
but it doesn't concern me right now.

173
07:46,947 --> 07:50,497
Dealing with irrational numbers in themselves is a big topic
we don't want to get into the details of.

174
07:50,937 --> 07:56,197
I want to understand now, what is the relationship between this
and the problems in the properties of numbers from 1 to 12?

175
07:56,997 --> 07:59,597
Let's look at this table, and what I mean will become clear.

176
08:01,237 --> 08:01,767
Okay.

177
08:03,237 --> 08:05,077
Here are the 12 properties I have.

178
08:05,667 --> 08:11,587
The first type of numbers was the Natural Numbers, and these are
the properties that work with them and those that don't work with them.

179
08:12,167 --> 08:15,937
When we added zero to the Natural Numbers, we got the Whole Numbers,
and here are their properties.

180
08:16,267 --> 08:20,407
So, the second property differentiates between Whole Numbers and Natural Numbers.

181
08:21,087 --> 08:27,797
And when we added negative numbers to the Whole Numbers, we got the Integers.
And here are the properties that align with Integers.

182
08:27,797 --> 08:31,357
It's clear that the third property differentiates between Integers and Whole Numbers.

183
08:32,107 --> 08:44,117
And when we added... sorry, when we added quotients, we got...
the quotients or the rational numbers. And here are their properties.

184
08:44,437 --> 08:51,237
It's clear that the seventh property differentiates between quotients
or rational numbers and the integers.

185
08:52,657 --> 08:55,147
So it's clear we are moving up a ladder like this.

186
08:55,147 --> 09:01,647
We add a type of number, and there's a property that distinguishes
between the new set of numbers and the set before it.

187
09:02,067 --> 09:07,427
And not only that, each set is a part of the larger set than it.

188
09:08,797 --> 09:11,177
Suddenly, the irrational numbers appeared to me.

189
09:11,467 --> 09:18,497
I didn't invent them; I was confronted by them. Meaning, we didn't make up something
called √2; it already existed. We just didn't know how to work with it.

190
09:18,497 --> 09:24,477
e, e is Euler's number. Pi (π), these are things that exist. Meaning, we ourselves wish
we had only rational numbers.

191
09:24,477 --> 09:32,147
I mean, people spent... many people dedicated their lives trying to find a fixed value
for these numbers and put them in quotient form, but they couldn't. Nobody knows how to do that.

192
09:32,497 --> 09:34,167
Therefore, this is a problem we were confronted with.

193
09:34,377 --> 09:35,187
And not only that.

194
09:35,807 --> 09:43,637
And this is the big problem. They do not belong to the quotients,
nor are the quotients part of them. They are like a separate set on their own.

195
09:44,207 --> 09:45,357
And not only that.

196
09:45,667 --> 09:53,837
The same properties, all of them, from 1 to 12, that work with rational numbers,
are the exact same properties that work exactly with irrational numbers.

197
09:54,467 --> 09:58,107
Therefore, I don't have any type of property that distinguishes between these two large sets.

198
09:58,107 --> 10:01,957
Meaning, if we wanted to put this matter in a Venn diagram, it would look like this.

199
10:02,247 --> 10:04,537
Here is N, the Natural Numbers.

200
10:05,187 --> 10:07,357
Add zero to them, you get W.

201
10:08,047 --> 10:10,187
Add negative numbers to them, you get Q...

202
10:10,747 --> 10:13,677
sorry, you get Z, which is the Integers.

203
10:14,287 --> 10:16,517
Add quotients to them, you get Q.

204
10:17,817 --> 10:26,777
The irrational numbers are a separate group here, which we call Irrational Numbers.

205
10:27,627 --> 10:29,667
It's a large group, its size is infinite.

206
10:30,907 --> 10:35,337
And properties 1 to 12 apply to Q.

207
10:35,977 --> 10:39,387
And properties 1 to 12 apply to the irrational numbers.

208
10:40,767 --> 10:46,147
Therefore, I cannot use these properties to find the value of √2.

209
10:46,947 --> 10:47,737
Keep in mind.

210
10:47,957 --> 10:54,847
All I proved in the previous proof was that there is no Q, no rational number,
that when I square it, gives me 2.

211
10:54,847 --> 11:04,127
What I proved here is that x² = (P/Q)² = 2... this situation doesn't exist.
There's no quotient I can square to get 2. This is all I proved.

212
11:04,127 --> 11:09,247
Which is this, from here.

213
11:10,717 --> 11:14,477
And I said it's here, among the irrational numbers, but I can't prove it.

214
11:14,477 --> 11:24,447
I don't have anything from properties 1 to 12, which are the same properties
I used in this proof, I can't use them here to say what the value of √2 is.
I know there is a value for √2.

215
11:24,447 --> 11:26,817
The fact that I have a symbol called √2...

216
11:26,817 --> 11:33,107
means it has a value. Not only that, geometry tells me there's something called √2.
Meaning, if we went to Pythagoras,

217
11:33,787 --> 11:39,977
if I have a right triangle where these two sides are the unit (1),

218
11:40,457 --> 11:41,957
this must be √2.

219
11:42,557 --> 11:43,967
This is what Pythagoras says.

220
11:44,217 --> 11:47,197
Therefore, I have a value in geometry telling me there's something called √2.

221
11:47,737 --> 11:56,147
All I proved is that this √2 is not a quotient, but I didn't prove its value
as an irrational number. I couldn't even prove it exists basically (algebraically using properties 1-12).

222
11:56,947 --> 11:59,137
And this is the problem. I hope it's clear.

223
11:59,677 --> 12:08,807
Of course, there could have been a simple solution: we add another property
that can... Ah, of course, before I forget, the group... this whole group is called Real Numbers.

224
12:13,997 --> 12:17,797
The story of this course is all about the topic of Real Numbers.

225
12:18,787 --> 12:26,427
As we said, I could add another property and deal with it, live my life with it,
just like I kept adding properties and numbers. Maybe I just add a property for irrational numbers.

226
12:26,427 --> 12:31,227
But the problem is that if I add a property for irrational numbers,
this approach won't work because...

227
12:31,727 --> 12:39,637
the property I would add here would conflict with something else later on.
I mean, it would clash with another mathematical concept somewhere else.

228
12:39,637 --> 12:46,207
Therefore, mathematicians like things to be smooth and consistent.
Meaning, when I add a rule here, it must work everywhere.

229
12:46,207 --> 12:51,947
It's not acceptable to add a rule in one place or a property in a specific place
that contradicts a rule or law in another place.

230
12:52,287 --> 12:54,627
If I did that with irrational numbers, it would lead to problems.

231
12:54,627 --> 12:57,637
For example, what is this? Square root of -1 (√-1).

232
12:58,227 --> 13:03,807
Give me the value of √-1. This is neither a quotient nor irrational.
Should I add a property for it too? No.

233
13:04,497 --> 13:12,797
Therefore, the author concluded that the solution to this whole dilemma
lies neither in studying numbers nor in studying the properties of numbers from the start.

234
13:13,227 --> 13:22,847
And this is the topic we will start talking about in the upcoming videos,
God willing, or starting from the next video, which is our discussion about Functions.

235
13:23,847 --> 13:31,817
And that the solution and our understanding of Real Numbers will be
in studying something else entirely, not the numbers.

236
13:32,347 --> 13:33,877
See you in the next video, God willing. Goodbye.
