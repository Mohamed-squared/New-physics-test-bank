00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:00,900
Peace be upon you.

2
00:00:20,447 --> 00:00:33,197
Before we dive into the topic of today's video, let's go back a bit and review the basic points and main topics we discussed in the past few videos, just so the structure of the course doesn't get lost.

3
00:00:35,137 --> 00:00:44,567
We started our discussion about Calculus by saying that Calculus consists of two main branches: differentiation and integration.

4
00:00:45,597 --> 00:00:54,417
We mentioned that when Newton and Leibniz started talking about these two topics, they relied on a concept that had some issues, which was infinitesimal numbers or infinitesimal values.

5
00:00:54,897 --> 00:01:03,747
And this issue was largely resolved when the concept of limits was introduced by the scientist Cauchy.

6
00:01:04,977 --> 00:01:11,437
Consequently, before we start working on differentiation and integration, we must have worked well, or sufficiently, on limits.

7
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:16,467
And before working on limits, we said we must understand what functions are.

8
00:01:17,217 --> 00:01:23,237
And before talking about functions, we said we would talk about real numbers.

9
00:01:24,197 --> 00:01:29,157
Indeed, that was our entry point into the course. We began our discussion talking about real numbers.

10
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:34,987
And we started talking about real numbers by discussing the 12 properties of numbers.

11
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:41,867
And we noticed that not all numbers satisfy all the properties of numbers.

12
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:47,977
Consequently, we discovered that there are different types of numbers: natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, quotients or rational numbers.

13
00:01:48,247 --> 00:01:54,067
On the other hand, there was also a large group of numbers which are the irrational numbers. Both together form the real numbers.

14
00:01:55,017 --> 00:02:06,367
At this specific point, a problem or dilemma arose for us. Rational numbers and irrational numbers... we know, and have proven, that they are two separate sets, or two distinct types of numbers or numerals.

15
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:13,047
However, we don't have any property among the 12 properties we listed that can distinguish between these two types.

16
00:02:13,047 --> 00:02:17,457
So, we had a dilemma here, and felt like we hit a dead end.

17
00:02:17,797 --> 00:02:22,797
So, we decided, okay, let's stop talking about real numbers for now and move on to the next topic, which is functions.

18
00:02:22,997 --> 00:02:27,087
Perhaps, God willing, the solution to the dilemma of real numbers lies within functions.

19
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:31,657
And that, God willing, is the topic we will start discussing in this video.

20
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:43,377
What does the word "functions" mean? Let's put its corresponding term in Arabic. We call it "Dala" (دالة) or we call it "Al-Iqtiran" (الاقتران).

21
00:02:45,497 --> 00:02:51,897
The word "Dala" is more commonly used in Egypt. Jordan, and likely most of the Levant countries, use the word "Al-Iqtiran".

22
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:56,207
We might come back to the topic of "Al-Iqtiran" later. Alright.

23
00:02:58,147 --> 00:03:03,437
The best introduction to the topic of functions, honestly, is the introduction given by Michael Spivak in the book we are working from.

24
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:10,917
The man said that, undoubtedly, the most important concept in all of mathematics is the concept of functions.

25
00:03:11,637 --> 00:03:19,377
And there is no branch in modern mathematics where functions are not the center of study or the center of research.

26
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:22,817
Of course, this statement needs no explanation.

27
00:03:22,817 --> 00:03:30,717
It's clear from these few words that functions are not something we can just skim over. You need to take your time with them and grasp them well.

28
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:38,247
Because, based on this statement and the structure we see before us, everything that comes after will be built upon the concept of functions.

29
00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:42,767
And by the way, this isn't just limited to mathematics; it's used in many other fields, like physics, for example.

30
00:03:43,237 --> 00:03:50,817
Therefore, you must pay some attention to the concept of functions before moving on to anything else in the remaining branches of mathematics.

31
00:03:51,937 --> 00:03:54,707
Alright. Historically, where did these functions come from?

32
00:03:55,457 --> 00:03:58,407
Of course, until now, we haven't said what functions are, nor have we discussed the concept of functions.

33
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:02,317
We're just, you know, finding an entry point to the topic now.

34
00:04:03,797 --> 00:04:13,047
Functions... it's not known exactly when they started as a concept, but serious discussion about them began around approximately the 14th century.

35
00:04:14,847 --> 00:04:24,337
However, the first time someone actually mentioned the word "functions" was specifically in the year 1673.

36
00:04:25,397 --> 00:04:37,947
That was the date someone mentioned the word "functions" and gave it a definition that was somewhat close, or a description close to the modern state that we currently use.

37
00:04:37,947 --> 00:04:46,257
So, we'll consider that functions appeared specifically around 1673, roughly.

38
00:04:48,047 --> 00:04:49,337
Okay, what's special about this date?

39
00:04:50,087 --> 00:04:59,677
What's special about this date is that a few years before it, specifically in 1665, Newton began writing his notes on Calculus.

40
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:09,457
And two years after this date, in 1675, Gottfried Leibniz was beginning to write his notes, also on Calculus.

41
00:05:10,887 --> 00:05:15,017
So, it's clear that functions appeared right in the midst of the hustle and bustle of Calculus.

42
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:20,237
And at the same time, I'm telling you that functions are what the rest of Calculus was built upon.

43
00:05:21,877 --> 00:05:29,827
The strange thing about this is that the person who mentioned the word "functions"... the person who mentioned the word "functions" on that date... was Gottfried Leibniz himself.

44
00:05:31,177 --> 00:05:38,837
Meaning, Gottfried Leibniz mentioned functions, and two years later, he talked about Calculus without mentioning functions within it.

45
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:41,707
He was talking about them in a somewhat separate manner.

46
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:52,277
What I want to say here is that functions and Calculus are two things linked together, despite the fact that those who created Calculus and those who created functions were not fully aware of this point.

47
00:05:52,537 --> 00:05:55,627
This matter started to become clearer later, in the 18th century.

48
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:16,407
However, because the two problems that functions and Calculus were addressing were very closely related, it was logical and natural that all scientists, including Gottfried Leibniz and Newton, would be trying to explore these two topics without even realizing they were mathematically connected.

49
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,077
This complexity will also become somewhat clearer later on.

50
00:06:20,077 --> 00:06:27,977
All I wanted to clarify for you here is that Calculus represents for us modern mathematics, or the beginning of modern mathematics and modern science in general.

51
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:32,657
And the function was right in the thick of the development of Calculus.

52
00:06:33,397 --> 00:06:42,837
Therefore, I return to the point Michael Spivak made a short while ago when he said that the function is the axis of research in all of modern mathematics.

53
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:49,597
When we look at it even from a historical perspective, we find that history supports this viewpoint. Okay.

54
00:06:51,737 --> 00:06:53,927
Before we end this video, there are two things I want to say.

55
00:06:54,007 --> 00:07:00,407
First thing, let's give an example of a function, without even writing any mathematical expression.

56
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:14,987
When we want to present the function simply... in a simple form... you can represent functions as follows: a function is essentially a table. Well, not exactly a table, but we can look at it as if it's a table.

57
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:19,607
This table says that a certain number corresponds to another certain number.

58
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:24,577
This number corresponds to that number, and this number corresponds to that number, and so on. Every number corresponds to another number.

59
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:25,857
What is this about?

60
00:07:26,557 --> 00:07:34,597
As you can see before you, a function is a rule or a principle that assigns a number to every number from a set of numbers.

61
00:07:34,597 --> 00:07:41,217
Meaning, it says, "I have this set of numbers," which is this column. Every number in it will correspond to a specific number.

62
00:07:42,257 --> 00:07:43,757
That's it. That's the function.

63
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:54,947
Why did I mention this topic in this way? I mentioned it to tell you that the Arabic term "Al-Iqtiran" (meaning association or coupling) is considered one of the closest terms, truly, to the definition of a function. Perhaps it's better than "Dala" and maybe even better than the word "functions" itself.

64
00:07:55,377 --> 00:08:01,197
Because the function is truly a process of association. All you are saying in a function is that this number is *associated* with that number.

65
08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,777
It's a matter of association. Okay?

66
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:05,997
It's not a matter of equality. I'm not saying that this number *equals* that number.

67
00:08:06,327 --> 00:08:10,547
All I'm saying is, let's say for example, number 2 corresponds to number 4.

68
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:15,597
That's all that the function, from a mathematical perspective, does. This is, of course, in a simplified way.

69
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:36,567
We will see this later, God willing, in detail - what this means, and give examples. But if you wanted to know why something as simple as this is something we're making a big deal out of, saying, you know... In the end, I've just put a table for you, saying that number 2 corresponds to number 4. What's all the big fuss we're making around this topic?

70
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:40,547
To understand something like this, it's simple. Look around you. Look at the universe around you.

71
00:08:41,077 --> 00:08:43,947
It's hard to find something, or an event, that happens in isolation.

72
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:48,577
For example, let's take an example... the speed of a car, for instance. You're driving a car...

73
00:08:48,577 --> 00:08:53,827
you press the gas pedal more, the car's speed increases. You press the gas pedal more, the car's speed increases even more, and so on.

74
00:08:53,827 --> 00:09:03,507
Therefore, the speed of the car, if you put it in this table, and put the amount of gasoline you're adding in this table, you can say that the amount of gasoline being added to the car is associated with the speed of the car, and so on.

75
00:09:04,317 --> 00:09:13,857
Apply this analogy to anything else, from population counts to geometric shapes... an example like the car... the load of, say, a truck.

76
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:19,067
If we have a truck, for instance, and we want to find the maximum speed of this truck.

77
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:22,997
If the truck is empty, or the transport vehicle is empty, its maximum speed will be somewhat high.

78
00:09:23,357 --> 00:09:27,167
As you add more load to it, its maximum speed tends to decrease, and so on.

79
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:31,307
Therefore, the weight of the load on the vehicle is associated with the maximum speed for that vehicle.

80
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:34,907
Of course, these are simple examples; we will see many more complex ones later.

81
00:09:35,827 --> 00:09:42,997
The gist of what I want to tell you is that the world around you, and the universe around you, events within it do not happen in isolation.

82
00:09:43,307 --> 00:09:45,807
An event always happens because of another event.

83
00:09:46,147 --> 00:09:48,847
The function solves this issue for me.

84
00:09:49,217 --> 00:09:57,447
The function allows me to study the interconnected events around me in a simple mathematical way, as we will see later on.

85
00:09:58,637 --> 01:01,437
See you in the next video, God willing. Peace be upon you.
