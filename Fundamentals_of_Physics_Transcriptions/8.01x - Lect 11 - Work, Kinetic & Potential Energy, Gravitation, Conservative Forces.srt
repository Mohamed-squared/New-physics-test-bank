00:00:00,851 --> 00:00:06,311
Today we will talk exclusively about work and energy.

2
00:00:06,671 --> 00:00:10,681
First, let's do one dimensional case.

3
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:18,321
The work that a force is doing when that force is moving from point A to point B,

4
00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:24,311
one dimensional. Here's point A and here is point B.

5
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:31,161
And the force is along that direction or either in this direction or in this direction, but it's completely one dimensional.

6
00:00:31,361 --> 00:00:39,681
That work is the integral in going from A to B of that force dx, if I call that the X-axis.

7
00:00:40,251 --> 00:00:44,201
The unit of work, you can see is Newton meters.

8
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:49,021
So work is Newton meters

9
00:00:49,331 --> 00:00:53,431
for which we we call that joule.

10
00:00:54,591 --> 00:01:04,661
If there's more than one force in this direction, you have to add these forces in this direction vectorially, and then this is the work that the forces do together.

11
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:07,171
Work is a scalar.

12
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:12,671
So this can be larger than zero, it can be zero, or it can be smaller than zero.

13
00:01:12,951 --> 00:01:18,961
If the force and the direction in which it moves are an opposite direction, then it is smaller than zero.

14
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:25,571
If they are in the same direction, either this way or that way, then the work is larger than zero.

15
00:01:26,471 --> 00:01:28,161
F equals MA.

16
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:42,411
So therefore, I can also write for this M DVDT and I can write down for DX, I can write down VDT.

17
00:01:43,211 --> 00:01:48,151
I substitute that in there. So the work in going from A to B

18
00:01:48,471 --> 00:02:00,541
is the integral from A to B times the force, which is M DVDT. The X, which is V DT.

19
00:02:00,851 --> 00:02:08,281
And look what I can do. I can eliminate time and I can now go to a integral over velocity.

20
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:19,161
The velocity A to the velocity B and I get M times V times DV.

21
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:38,481
That's a very easy integral. That is 1/2 M V squared, which I have to evaluate between VA and VB. And that is 1/2 M VB squared - 1/2 M VA squared.

22
00:02:39,531 --> 00:02:46,491
1/2 MV squared is what we call in physics kinetic energy.

23
00:02:47,121 --> 00:02:50,131
Sometimes we write just a K for that.

24
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:52,661
It's the energy of motion.

25
00:02:53,811 --> 00:03:01,051
And so the work that is done when a force moves from A to B

26
00:03:01,701 --> 00:03:14,391
is the kinetic energy in point B, you see that here, minus the kinetic energy in point A. And this is called the work energy theorem.

27
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:21,021
If the work is positive, then the kinetic energy increases when you go from A to B.

28
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:31,381
If the work is smaller than zero, then the work, then the kinetic energy decreases. If the work is zero, then there is no change in kinetic energy.

29
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:38,771
Let's do a simple example applying this work energy theorem.

30
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:43,501
I have an object that I want to move from A to B.

31
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:52,741
I let gravity do that. I give it a velocity. Here is the velocity V of A.

32
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:56,441
And let the separation be H.

33
00:03:56,821 --> 00:04:02,261
And this could be my increasing Y direction.

34
00:04:02,761 --> 00:04:09,381
The object has a mass M and so there is a force gravitational force which is mg.

35
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:17,921
And if I want to give it a vector notation, it's mg Y roof. this is my increasing value of Y.

36
00:04:18,751 --> 00:04:27,651
When it reaches point B, it comes to a halt. And I'm going to ask you now, what is the value of H? We've done that in the past in a different way.

37
00:04:27,651 --> 00:04:32,971
Now we will do it purely based on the energy considerations.

38
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:44,421
So, I can write down that the work that gravity is doing in going from A to B, that work is clearly negative. The force is in this direction and the motion is in this direction.

39
00:04:44,761 --> 00:04:51,711
So the work that gravity is doing in going from A to B equals minus mggh.

40
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:55,111
That must be the kinetic energy at that point B.

41
00:04:55,411 --> 00:05:05,441
So that this kinetic energy at point B minus the kinetic energy at point A. This is zero because it comes to a hold here.

42
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:14,431
And so you find that 1/2 M VA squared equals mgh.

43
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:26,241
M cancels and so you'll find that the height that you reach equals VA squared divided by 2g.

44
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:35,511
And this is something we have seen before. It was easy for us to derive it in the past, but now we've done it purely based on energy considerations.

45
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:39,081
I'd like to do a second example.

46
00:05:39,601 --> 00:05:46,051
I lift an object from A to B. I Walter Lewin.

47
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:51,511
I take it at A. It has no speed here. VA is zero.

48
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:56,811
It has no speed there. And I bring it from here to here.

49
00:05:58,361 --> 00:06:05,791
There's a gravitational force mg in this direction. So the force where Walter Lewin must be in this direction.

50
00:06:06,461 --> 00:06:11,301
So the motion and my force are in the same direction.

51
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:16,101
So the work that I'm doing is clearly plus MGH.

52
00:06:16,411 --> 00:06:23,101
So the work that Walter Lewin is doing is plus MGH when the object goes from A to B.

53
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:34,781
The work that gravity was doing was minus MGH, we just saw that. So the net work that is done is zero and you see there is indeed no change in kinetic energy.

54
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:40,711
There was no kinetic energy here to start with and there's no kinetic energy there.

55
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:48,071
If I take my briefcase and I bring it up here, I've done positive work.

56
00:06:48,571 --> 00:06:51,231
If I bring it down, I've done negative work.

57
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:55,021
If I bring it up, I do again positive work.

58
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,591
When I do positive work, gravity does negative work.

59
00:06:57,811 --> 00:07:02,431
When I do negative work, like I do now, gravity does positive work.

60
00:07:02,731 --> 00:07:06,941
And I can do that a whole day and the net amount of work that I have done is zero.

61
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:11,961
Positive work, negative work, positive work, negative work.

62
00:07:12,341 --> 00:07:16,651
I will get very tired. Don't confuse getting tired with doing work.

63
00:07:17,081 --> 00:07:20,621
I would have done no work and I would be very tired.

64
00:07:20,921 --> 00:07:26,961
I think we would all agree that if I stand here 24 hours like this, that I would get very tired.

65
00:07:27,211 --> 00:07:33,331
I haven't done any work. I might as well put it here and let the table just hold that briefcase for me.

66
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:38,521
So it's clear that you can get very tired without having done any work.

67
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:42,951
So this is the way we define work in physics.

68
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:46,861
Now let's go from one dimensions to three dimensions.

69
00:07:47,161 --> 00:07:49,631
It is not very much different as you will see.

70
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:56,941
I go in three dimensions from point A to point B.

71
00:07:57,211 --> 00:08:07,341
And I now have a force which could be pointing not just along the X direction, but in general in all directions.

72
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:16,511
Now the work that the force is doing in going from A to B is F.dr.

73
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:25,651
R is the position in three-dimensional space where the force is at that moment and DR is a small displacement.

74
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:31,351
So, if this is from A to B,

75
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:42,331
then DR here, if you go in this direction, this would be the little vector DR. and here, that would be a little vector DR.

76
00:08:42,551 --> 00:08:49,011
And the force itself could be like this here, and the force could be like this there.

77
00:08:50,311 --> 00:08:54,821
The force can obviously change along this path.

78
00:08:56,071 --> 00:09:01,071
So let the force be

79
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:11,811
f(x) X roof + f(y) Y roof + f(z) Z roof.

80
00:09:12,171 --> 00:09:16,371
I'll move this A up a little, put it here.

81
00:09:16,671 --> 00:09:31,231
And let dr, the general notation for vector dr, equals dx X roof + dy Y roof + dz Z roof.

82
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,721
Cannot be anymore general.

83
00:09:34,101 --> 00:09:41,201
So the work that this force is doing when it moves from A to B

84
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:49,071
is the integral of Fdr.

85
00:09:49,451 --> 00:09:54,561
Let's first take a small displacement over DR.

86
00:09:55,031 --> 00:09:57,671
Then I get DW that is simply

87
00:09:57,671 --> 00:10:12,881
f(x) times dx, it's a scalar, because this is a dot product, plus f(y) dy plus f(z) dz.

88
00:10:13,451 --> 00:10:22,361
That is little bit amount of work if the force is displaced over a distance DR.

89
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:28,611
Now I have to do the integral over the entire path to get W.

90
00:10:29,151 --> 00:10:31,461
from A to B.

91
00:10:32,691 --> 00:10:35,701
That's an integral going from A to B.

92
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:39,051
Integral going from A to B.

93
00:10:39,611 --> 00:10:44,441
I don't need this anymore.

94
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:48,351
Integral going from A to B.

95
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:51,591
Integral going from A to B.

96
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:55,221
Now we're home free because we already did this.

97
00:10:55,531 --> 00:11:01,341
This is a one dimensional problem and the one dimensional problem, we already know the outcome.

98
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:14,421
The integral F dx, we found that is 1/2 m Vb2 - m V2, which in this case is obviously the velocity in the X direction because this is a one dimensional problem.

99
00:11:15,061 --> 00:11:22,311
And the one dimensional problem indicates that the velocity that I'm dealing with is the component in this direction.

100
00:11:22,631 --> 00:11:35,301
So we have that this is 1/2 M V b squared and it's the X component minus V squared and that is the X component.

101
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:42,441
This is also a one dimensional problem now, except that now I deal with the component with the Y component of the velocity.

102
00:11:42,441 --> 00:12:03,381
So I get 1/2 M times VB Y squared - VA Y squared + 1/2 M VB Z squared - VA Z squared.

103
00:12:03,811 --> 00:12:05,151
And now we're home free.

104
00:12:05,611 --> 00:12:19,671
Because what you see here is you see V squared in the X direction, V squared Y component, V squared Z component. And if you add those three up, you get exactly the square of the velocity. You get the square of the speed.

105
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:28,001
So if you add up these three terms, you get up, you get VB squared.

106
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:31,041
Oh, I lost my M. I put my M in there.

107
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:36,141
1/2 M times VB squared. And here you see

108
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:47,201
AX squared, AY squared, AZ squared - VA squared. And you get exactly the same result that you had before.

109
00:12:47,481 --> 00:12:52,161
Namely that the work done is the difference in kinetic energy.

110
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:56,821
You can always think of these as speeds.

111
00:12:57,351 --> 00:13:02,241
velocity squared is the speed. It's the magnitude squared of the velocity.

112
00:13:04,641 --> 00:13:05,781
All right.

113
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:13,841
I'd like to return to gravity and work on a three-dimensional situation.

114
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:23,841
We have here. Let this be X, this be Y, and this be Z.

115
00:13:24,581 --> 00:13:28,121
And there is here, this is the increasing value of Y.

116
00:13:28,451 --> 00:13:33,731
And there is here point A in three dimensions like this.

117
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:39,171
And there is here point B.

118
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:48,681
So you get a rough idea about the three dimensions. And Y of B - Y of A equals h.

119
00:13:48,681 --> 00:13:52,601
That's a given. So there's a high difference between A and between B.

120
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:58,661
There is a gravitational force. The object moves from A to B. Suppose it moves in some crazy way.

121
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:04,671
Of course, gravity alone could not do that. There has to be another force if it goes in a strange way.

122
00:14:05,021 --> 00:14:10,271
But I'm only calculating now the work that's going to be done by gravity. The other forces I ignore for now.

123
00:14:10,561 --> 00:14:13,501
I only want to know the work that gravity is doing.

124
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:20,341
The object has a mass M and so there is a force mg.

125
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:26,571
And I can write down this force in vector notation. It's in this direction.

126
00:14:27,321 --> 00:14:41,641
So now I notice that there is only a value for f of y, but there is no value for f of x and there is no value for f x. They are zero.

127
00:14:42,241 --> 00:14:46,161
And so f of y equals - mg.

128
00:14:46,611 --> 00:14:57,641
And so if I calculate now the work in going from A to B, which is the integral in going from A to B of f.dr.

129
00:14:58,071 --> 00:15:10,551
Then the only term that I have is the one that deals with the Y direction. So it is the integral in going from A to B of f dy.

130
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:26,231
And that equals - mg because we have the - mg times Y of B - Y of A. So that is - mg times h.

131
00:15:26,831 --> 00:15:39,671
And what you see here that it is completely independent of the path that I have chosen. Doesn't matter how I move. The only thing that matters is the difference in height between point A and point B.

132
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:44,231
H could be larger than zero if B is above A.

133
00:15:44,231 --> 00:15:50,821
It could be smaller than zero if B is below A. It could be equal to zero if B has the same height as A.

134
00:15:51,311 --> 00:16:02,881
Whenever the work that is done by a force is independent of its path, is only determined by the starting point and the endpoint, that force is called a conservative force.

135
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:19,221
It's a very important concept in physics. I will repeat it. Whenever the work that is done by a force in going from one point to another is independent of the path, it's only determined by the starting point and the endpoint, we call that a conservative force.

136
00:16:19,401 --> 00:16:22,671
Gravity is a conservative force. It's very clear.

137
00:16:23,981 --> 00:16:24,771
Suppose

138
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:41,201
that I do the work that I go from A to B in some very strange way, then it is very clear that the work that I would have done would be plus MGH because my force of course

139
00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:45,821
is exactly in the opposite direction as gravity.

140
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:51,381
So whenever gravity is doing positive work, I would be doing negative work.

141
00:16:51,381 --> 00:16:57,681
If I hold it in my hand, when I'm doing positive work, gravity is doing negative work.

142
01:02:371 --> 01:07,281
Again, I'm going to concentrate now on a case where we deal with gravity only.

143
01:08,051 --> 01:14,681
When there's only gravity, then we have that minus mgh

144
01:15,601 --> 01:21,521
is the work done in going from A to B equals

145
01:21,861 --> 01:38,501
- mg * Y of B - Y of A. And that now is the kinetic energy at point B minus the kinetic energy at point A. This is the work energy theorem.

146
01:39,251 --> 01:46,071
Look closely here. I can rearrange this and I can bring the B's on one side. I can bring the A's on one side.

147
01:46,421 --> 01:55,271
I then get mg * Y of B plus the kinetic energy at point B equals

148
01:55,321 --> 02:02,081
mg * Y of A plus the kinetic energy at point A.

149
02:02,441 --> 02:04,651
And this is truly an amazing result.

150
02:07,031 --> 02:23,961
We call MGY, we give that a name, and we call that gravitational potential energy. Often we write for that PE, or we write for that a U.

151
02:24,871 --> 02:40,651
And what you're seeing here is that the sum of potential energy at point B and the kinetic energy at point B is the same as the potential energy at A and the kinetic energy at point A.

152
02:41,231 --> 02:56,191
One can be converted into the other and it can be converted back. kinetic energy can be converted back to potential energy and potential energy can be converted back, but the sum of them, which we call mechanical energy is conserved.

153
02:56,641 --> 03:02,491
And mechanical energy is only conserved if the force is a conservative force.

154
03:03,011 --> 03:06,361
It's extremely useful. We will use it many times, but you have to be very careful.

155
03:07,181 --> 03:13,811
It's a dangerous tool because it's only true when the force is conservative.

156
03:14,531 --> 03:17,041
Spring forces are also conservative.

157
03:17,361 --> 03:21,541
But for instance, friction is not a conservative force.

158
03:21,851 --> 03:29,051
If I move an object from here to here,

159
03:29,381 --> 03:32,141
suppose I move this object.

160
03:32,511 --> 03:37,851
And I go along a straight line, then the friction is doing negative work. I am doing positive work.

161
03:38,141 --> 03:42,511
But now suppose I go from here to here through this routing.

162
03:43,491 --> 03:47,541
You can see that the work I have to do is much more.

163
03:50,121 --> 03:52,451
Friction is not a conservative force.

164
03:52,451 --> 04:07,111
The frictional force remains constant depending on the friction, the kinetic friction coefficient is always the same, the frictional force which I have to overcome as I move and so if I go all the way here and then all the way back to this point where I wanted to be, then I have done a lot more work than if I go along the shortest distance.

165
04:07,111 --> 04:12,221
So friction is a classic example of a force that is not conservative.

166
04:18,101 --> 04:32,681
If I look at this result, the sum of gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy is conserved for gravitational force, then it is immediately obvious where we put the zero of kinetic energy.

167
04:33,141 --> 04:38,181
The zero of kinetic energy is when the object has no velocity because kinetic energy

168
04:38,521 --> 04:42,341
equals 1/2 M V squared.

169
04:42,641 --> 04:46,161
So if the object has no velocity, then there is no kinetic energy.

170
04:46,821 --> 04:49,061
How about potential energy?

171
04:49,611 --> 05:01,131
Well, you will say, sure, potential energy must be zero when Y is zero because that's the way that we defined it. You see, mgY is gravitational potential energy.

172
05:01,131 --> 05:07,291
So you would think that U is zero when Y is zero. Not an unreasonable thing to think.

173
05:07,741 --> 05:09,501
But where is Y is zero?

174
05:10,371 --> 05:12,441
Is Y zero at the surface of the earth?

175
05:13,151 --> 05:16,201
Or is Y zero at the floor of 26 100? Or is Y zero here?

176
05:16,791 --> 05:19,421
Or is Y zero the roof?

177
05:19,791 --> 05:26,541
Well, you are completely free to choose where you put U equals zero.

178
05:26,781 --> 05:37,841
It doesn't matter. As long as point A and point B are close enough together that the gravitational acceleration G is very closely the same for both points.

179
05:38,381 --> 05:53,171
The only thing what matters then is how far they are separated vertically. The only thing that matters is that UB - UA would be MGH.

180
05:53,451 --> 06:02,541
It's only the H that matters. And so you can then simply choose U zero anywhere you want to.

181
06:03,131 --> 06:04,041
It's easy to see.

182
06:04,561 --> 06:10,551
Suppose I have here point A and I have here point B.

183
06:11,241 --> 06:15,111
And suppose this separation was h.

184
06:16,131 --> 06:23,141
Well, if you prefer to call zero potential energy at A, I have no problems with that.

185
06:23,941 --> 06:27,381
So we can call this U equals zero here.

186
06:28,471 --> 06:33,411
Then you would have to call this U, you have to call it plus MGH.

187
06:34,081 --> 06:37,501
If you say, no, I don't want to do that. I want to call this zero. That's fine.

188
06:38,211 --> 06:41,481
Then this becomes minus MGH.

189
06:42,051 --> 06:52,501
If you prefer to call this zero, that's fine too, then this will have a positive gravitational potential energy, and this will have one that is higher than this one by this amount.

190
06:52,801 --> 06:56,501
If you say, really, I'd like to call this zero, of course, the same holds.

191
06:56,871 --> 07:07,211
What matters is what the difference between potential energy is, that is what we need when we apply the conservation of mechanical energy. That is what we need in order to evaluate how the object changes its kinetic energy.

192
07:07,481 --> 07:14,491
So where you choose your zero is completely up to you.

193
07:16,261 --> 07:24,621
As long as A and B are close enough so that there is no noticeable difference in the gravitational acceleration G.

194
07:25,071 --> 07:34,911
Uh, before the end of this hour, I will also evaluate the situation that G is changing when you go far away from the earth, G is changing.

195
07:35,411 --> 07:44,531
So let us first do look at a consequence of the conservation of mechanical energy.

196
07:46,591 --> 07:53,301
Very powerful concept, and as long as we deal with gravity, you can always use it.

197
07:53,791 --> 07:57,751
You see here on the desk something that looks like a roller coaster.

198
07:58,381 --> 08:05,401
And I'm going to slide an object

199
08:06,021 --> 08:07,391
from this direction.

200
08:07,811 --> 08:10,471
Let's clean it a little bit better.

201
08:13,481 --> 08:15,661
Here is that roller coaster.

202
08:16,301 --> 08:22,101
This is a circle and then it goes up again.

203
08:22,781 --> 08:25,951
So let the circle have a radius R.

204
08:26,291 --> 08:27,701
This point be A.

205
08:28,101 --> 08:34,321
I release it with zero speed. I assume that there is no friction for now.

206
08:34,901 --> 08:37,001
This point B B.

207
08:38,851 --> 08:47,691
And I define here Y = 0 or what is even more important, I define that U equals zero.

208
08:48,071 --> 08:51,371
And this is the direction positive direction of Y.

209
08:51,901 --> 08:56,531
At A, the object has no velocity, no speed.

210
08:57,021 --> 09:02,401
At B, of course, it does. It has converted some potential energy to kinetic energy.

211
09:02,701 --> 09:16,671
At this point C is had reached the maximum velocity that it can ever have because all the potential energy has been converted to kinetic energy and at this point D, if it ever reaches that point,

212
09:18,131 --> 09:21,651
that will be the velocity, say.

213
09:23,171 --> 09:31,311
Okay, I start off point A is at a different at a distance H above this level.

214
09:31,691 --> 09:34,581
And so I apply now the conservation of mechanical energy.

215
09:35,511 --> 09:57,721
So I know that U at A plus the kinetic energy at A, which is zero, must be U at B plus kinetic energy at B, must be U at C plus kinetic energy at C, must be U at D plus kinetic energy at D. If there is no friction, if there are no other forces, only gravity. So we lose no no energy goes lost in terms of friction.

216
10:03,301 --> 10:09,191
We know that this high difference is 2 R.

217
10:12,331 --> 10:18,011
And so now I can write this in general terms of Y. point say take this

218
10:18,501 --> 10:24,241
this point B. think of that being at a location Y above the zero line.

219
10:24,611 --> 10:35,461
Then I can write down now that UA which is MGH, that was a given when I started, that was all the energy I had, that was my total mechanical energy. If I call this U zero, which is free choice I have,

220
10:37,571 --> 10:48,181
equals U of B, which is now mg Y plus 12 M V squared at that position Y.

221
10:48,411 --> 10:52,581
This should hold what you see there should hold for every point that I have here.

222
10:52,581 --> 10:55,401
It should hold for A, for B, for C, for D, for any point.

223
10:56,051 --> 10:57,881
I lose my M.

224
10:59,221 --> 11:11,381
And so you find here that V squared equals 2g times h - Y.

225
11:12,841 --> 11:14,991
So this should hold for all these points.

226
11:15,351 --> 11:17,621
Therefore it should also hold for point D.

227
11:18,321 --> 11:29,521
However, at point D, there is something very important. There is a requirement. There is a requirement that there is a centripetal acceleration which is in this direction,

228
11:31,651 --> 11:33,571
a centripetal

229
11:33,841 --> 11:40,211
and that centripetal acceleration is a must for this object to reach that point D.

230
11:40,581 --> 11:49,541
And that centripetal acceleration, as we remember from when we played with the bucket of water, that is V squared divided by R.

231
11:50,641 --> 11:56,741
And this must be larger or equal to the gravitational acceleration G.

232
11:56,931 --> 12:02,151
If it is not larger, the bucket of water would not have made it to that point D.

233
12:02,711 --> 12:06,301
So this is my second equation that I'm going to use.

234
12:06,301 --> 12:12,221
So look very carefully. So V square must be larger or equal than GR.

235
12:12,541 --> 12:25,491
So I have here V square, which is 2g * h - Y, but Y for that point D is 2 R. So I put in a 2 R must be larger

236
12:25,771 --> 12:28,191
or equal to GR.

237
12:29,281 --> 12:31,491
I lose my G.

238
12:32,081 --> 12:37,981
So 2h - 4R must be larger or equal to R.

239
12:38,241 --> 12:43,091
So H must be larger or equal to 2 and 1/2 R.

240
12:43,561 --> 12:48,971
This is a classic result that almost every person who has taken physics will remember.

241
12:49,521 --> 12:51,541
It is by no means intuitive.

242
12:52,131 --> 13:03,161
It means that if I have this a ball here, and I will show you that shortly, and I let the ball go into this roller coaster, that it will not make this point

243
13:03,651 --> 13:12,641
unless I release it from a point that is at least two and a half times the radius of this circle above the zero level.

244
13:12,901 --> 13:15,321
If I do it any lower, it will not make it.

245
13:16,121 --> 13:26,571
So think about this, that is something that you could not have just easily predicted. It's a very strong result, but it is not something that you say intuitively, Oh yes, of course.

246
13:26,831 --> 13:30,991
It follows immediately from the conservation of mechanical energy.

247
13:31,631 --> 13:36,931
So, if I release it, that that two and 1/2 radius point, by the way, is somewhere here.

248
13:37,261 --> 13:42,701
So if I release this object way below that, it will not make this point.

249
13:42,971 --> 13:46,401
Let's do that. You see it didn't make it.

250
13:46,601 --> 13:48,841
I go a little higher. Didn't make it.

251
13:49,181 --> 13:51,661
Go a little higher. Didn't make it.

252
13:51,921 --> 13:55,441
Go a little higher. Still didn't make it.

253
13:56,131 --> 13:58,601
Now, I go to the two and a half mark.

254
14:00,471 --> 14:02,551
And now it makes it.

255
14:03,081 --> 14:11,551
2 and 1/2 times the radius conservation of mechanical energy tells you that that is the minimum it takes to just go through that point.

256
14:12,101 --> 14:18,151
Of course, if there were no loss of energy at all, if there were no mechanical energy lost, that means if there were no friction,

257
14:18,571 --> 14:25,451
then if I were to release it at this point, it would have to make it back to this point again with zero kinetic energy.

258
14:25,451 --> 14:32,401
But that won't, that's not the case. There is always a little bit of friction with the track for one thing, and also, of course, with air.

259
14:32,631 --> 14:39,111
So if I release it all the way here, you will not expect it that it will bounce up all the way to here.

260
14:39,321 --> 14:46,021
It will probably stop somewhere there. It may not even make it to the end. We can try that. Oh, it made it somewhere to here.

261
14:46,271 --> 14:51,281
So a little lower than that level, because there is some friction that avoidable.

262
14:53,111 --> 14:54,371
All right.

263
14:55,141 --> 15:08,271
This is a classic one. many exams where this problem is being given. I won't give it to you this time, but it's a classic one. You see it on the general exams of for physics and it's simply a matter of conservation of mechanical energy.

264
15:09,341 --> 15:26,041
Let's now look at the situation whereby A and B are so far apart that the gravitational acceleration is no longer constant and so you can no longer simply say that the difference in potential energy between point B and point A is simply mggh.

265
15:27,031 --> 15:39,141
So, now we are dealing with a very important concept and that is the gravitational force. We can think of the earth

266
15:40,051 --> 15:48,321
acting on a mass, or you can think of the sun acting on a planet, whichever you prefer.

267
15:48,651 --> 15:53,331
But that's what I want to deal with when the distances are now very large.

268
15:53,791 --> 15:58,771
Let me first give you the formal definition of gravitational potential energy.

269
15:59,521 --> 16:06,521
The formal definition is that the gravitational potential energy at a point P

270
16:07,031 --> 16:14,651
is the work that I Walter Lewin have to do to bring that mass from infinity to that point P.

271
16:15,631 --> 16:21,291
Now, you may say that's very strange that in physics there are definitions which where Walter Lewin comes in.

272
16:21,291 --> 16:33,431
Well, we can change it to gravity because my force is always the same force as gravity with a minus sign. So it's also minus the work that gravity does when the object moves from infinity to that point P.

273
16:33,691 --> 16:38,691
I just like to think of it, it's easier for me to think of it as the work that I do.

274
16:39,421 --> 16:47,741
So, if we apply that concept, then we first have to know what is the gravitational force.

275
16:48,331 --> 16:54,991
If this is an object capital M, and you can think of this as being the earth if you want to. And there is here an object

276
16:55,541 --> 17:01,011
little M, then I have to know what the forces are between the two. And this now is the is Newton's

277
17:01,751 --> 17:14,511
universal law of gravity which he postulated Universal law of gravity.

278
17:18,231 --> 17:22,361
He says the force that little M experiences

279
17:23,251 --> 17:34,221
this force equals I'll put a little M here and a capital M here. So it is little M experiences that force due to the presence of capital M.

280
17:34,621 --> 17:49,541
equals little M times capital M times a constant which Newton in his days didn't know yet what that value was divided by r squared if R is the distance between the two.

281
17:51,041 --> 18:10,621
This object, since Newton's third law holds, action equals minus reaction, this force, which is I will indicate it as capital M, little M, it is the force that this one experiences due to the presence of this one, is exactly the same in magnitude, but opposite in direction.

282
18:10,891 --> 18:14,241
And that is the universal law of gravity.

283
18:15,001 --> 18:17,631
Gravity is always attractive.

284
18:18,271 --> 18:24,631
Gravity sucks. That's the way to think of it. Always attracts. There is no such thing as repelling forces.

285
18:25,051 --> 18:39,321
The gravitational constant G is an extremely low number. 6.67 * 10 to the minus 11 in our SI units, which is Newton square meters per kilogram or something like that.

286
18:39,571 --> 18:54,141
That's an extremely low number. It means that if I have two objects which are each 1 kg, which I have now here about 1 m apart,

287
18:54,391 --> 19:01,471
that the force which they attract each other is only 6.67 * 10 to the minus 11 Newtons.

288
19:01,841 --> 19:05,021
That is an extremely small force.

289
19:08,121 --> 19:14,151
If this were the earth, and I am here, and this is my mass,

290
19:14,641 --> 19:24,451
then I experience a force which is given by this equation. This would be then the mass of the of the earth.

291
19:24,751 --> 19:27,451
Now F equals MA.

292
19:28,411 --> 19:32,631
So if I am here, I experience a gravitational acceleration.

293
19:32,991 --> 19:39,601
And the gravitational acceleration that I experience is therefore given by mg divided by r squared.

294
19:40,501 --> 19:51,321
And so you see that the gravitational acceleration that I experience at different distances from the earth, or for that matter, at different distances from the sun, is inversely proportional with r squared.

295
19:51,321 --> 20:07,461
We have discussed that earlier when we dealt with the planets and we dealt with uniform circular motions and we evaluated the centripetal acceleration, we came exactly to that conclusion that the gravitational acceleration falls off as 1/r squared.

296
20:07,461 --> 20:13,491
10 times further away, the gravitational acceleration is down by a factor of 100.

297
20:14,801 --> 20:32,381
If you are standing near the surface of the earth, then of course, the force that I will experience is my mass times the mass of the earth times the gravitational constant divided by the radius of the earth squared.

298
20:32,381 --> 20:41,801
just like we are here in 26 100. And so this must be mg. That's the gravitational acceleration if we drop an object here.

299
20:42,081 --> 20:48,031
And so you see that this now is our famous G and that is the famous 9.8.

300
20:48,031 --> 21:06,111
If you substitute in there the mass of the earth, which is 6 * 10 to the 24 kg, you put in here the gravitational constant, and you put in the radius of the earth, which is 6,400 km, out pops our well-known number of 9.8 meters per second squared.

301
21:08,011 --> 21:19,321
Okay. My goal was to evaluate for you the gravitational potential energy, the way that it is defined

302
21:20,081 --> 21:25,671
in general, not in a special case when we are near the earth.

303
21:26,431 --> 21:37,961
So, we now have to move an object from infinity to a point P and we calculate the work that I have to do.

304
21:38,531 --> 21:42,181
So here is capital M.

305
21:43,461 --> 21:48,441
And here is that point P and infinity is somewhere there.

306
21:49,181 --> 21:51,261
It's very, very far away.

307
21:51,591 --> 21:59,931
And I come in from infinity with that object with mass M and I finally land at point P.

308
22:01,451 --> 22:14,071
Since gravity is a conservative force and since my force is always the same in magnitude except in opposite direction, it doesn't matter how I move in, it will always come up with the same answer.

309
22:14,581 --> 22:24,261
So, we might as well do it in a civilized way and simply move that object in from infinity along a straight line.

310
22:25,081 --> 22:29,491
It should make no difference because gravity is a conservative force.

311
22:30,191 --> 22:33,101
So infinity is somewhere there.

312
22:35,001 --> 22:43,091
The force that I will experience, that I will have to produce

313
22:43,621 --> 22:46,221
is this force.

314
22:47,091 --> 22:49,471
Force of gravity is this one.

315
22:49,761 --> 22:55,461
The two are identical, except that mine is in this direction. This is increasing value of R.

316
22:55,461 --> 23:08,661
So mine would be plus m mg divided by r squared, if I'm here at location R. And let this be at a distance capital R from this object.

317
23:10,161 --> 23:22,701
You can already see that the gravitational potential energy, when I come from infinity with a force in this direction and I move inward, you can already see that gravitational potential energy will always be negative.

318
23:23,121 --> 23:28,531
For all points, anywhere, doesn't matter where I am, it will always be negative.

319
23:29,211 --> 23:34,071
And you may say, gee, that's sort of a strange thing, negative potential energy.

320
23:34,611 --> 23:36,591
Well, that is not a problem.

321
23:37,041 --> 23:45,611
Remember that depending upon how you define your zero level here, you also end up with negative values for potential energy.

322
23:45,611 --> 23:47,401
So there's nothing sacred about that.

323
23:47,401 --> 23:58,611
What is important, of course, if we get the right answer for the gravitational potential energy, that when we move away from this object, that the gravitational potential energy increases. That's all that matters.

324
23:59,001 --> 24:03,811
whether it is negative or positive is irrelevant.

325
24:05,081 --> 24:14,451
So, we already know it's going to be negative. And so we can now evaluate the work that I have to do when I go from infinity to that position capital R.

326
24:14,891 --> 24:28,221
So here comes the work that Walter Lewin has to do when we go from infinity to that point which is capital R radius from this object. Think of it as the sun or the earth, either one is fine.

327
24:28,501 --> 24:33,771
So that is the integral going from infinity to R

328
24:34,571 --> 24:46,081
of my force, which is plus because it's increasing value of R, m mg divided by r squared dr.

329
24:46,601 --> 24:48,501
That's a very easy integral.

330
24:49,351 --> 24:51,251
This is -1 over R.

331
24:51,761 --> 24:59,761
So I get mg over R with a minus sign, and that has to be evaluated between infinity and capital R.

332
25:01,071 --> 25:04,551
When I substitute for R infinity, I get a zero.

333
25:05,151 --> 25:11,631
And so the answer is minus mg over capital R.

334
25:12,081 --> 25:22,441
And this is the potential gravitational potential energy at any distance capital R that you please away from this object.

335
25:24,711 --> 25:29,761
At infinity, it's now always zero.

336
25:30,831 --> 25:37,171
Earlier you had a choice where you chose your zero when you're near earth and when G doesn't change, you had a choice.

337
25:37,331 --> 25:38,931
Now you no longer have a choice.

338
25:39,181 --> 25:44,711
Now the gravitational potential energy at infinity is fixed at zero.

339
25:46,781 --> 25:54,681
So let's look at this function and let us make a plot of this function

340
25:55,191 --> 25:56,891
as a function of distance.

341
25:57,381 --> 26:03,011
So the 1 over R relationship of the gravitational potential energy.

342
26:05,101 --> 26:08,351
The force, gravitational force falls off as 1/ r squared.

343
26:12,711 --> 26:14,191
Here is zero.

344
26:14,811 --> 26:20,011
This is the gravitational potential energy. All these values here are negative.

345
26:20,381 --> 26:25,991
And here I plotted as a function, I use the symbol little R now instead of capital R.

346
26:26,331 --> 26:35,311
And so the curve would be something like this. This is proportional to 1/ R.

347
26:38,081 --> 26:54,951
If you move an object from A to B, and this separation is H, and if A and B are very far apart, the difference in potential energy is no longer MGH,

348
26:55,691 --> 27:05,891
but the difference in potential energy is the difference between this value and this value. And you have to use that equation to evaluate that.

349
27:06,241 --> 27:15,141
But you can clearly see that if I go from here to here, if I take an object and go from here to here, that the potential energy will increase and that's all that matters.

350
27:15,791 --> 27:24,411
So it increases when you go further away from the earth, if you look at the earth, or from the sun, if you look at the sun.

351
27:28,181 --> 27:36,991
Is there any disagreement between this result that we have here and the result that we found there?

352
27:38,021 --> 27:39,311
And the answer is no.

353
27:39,911 --> 27:42,361
I invite you to go through the following exercise.

354
27:43,031 --> 27:50,101
Take a point A in space which is at a distance RA from the center of the earth, say.

355
27:50,691 --> 27:57,511
And I do that, I start at the surface of the earth itself. So the radius is the radius of the earth.

356
27:58,251 --> 28:07,041
And I go to point B, which is a little bit further away from the center of the earth, only a distance H. And H is way, way, way smaller

357
28:07,691 --> 28:12,341
than the radius of the earth.

358
28:13,091 --> 28:21,231
So I can calculate now what the difference in potential energy is between point B and point A.

359
28:21,701 --> 28:24,571
And I can use and I should use this equation.

360
28:25,211 --> 28:37,081
And when I use that equation and you use the Taylor's expansion, the first order Taylor's expansion, you will immediately see that the result that you find collapses into this result.

361
28:37,561 --> 28:49,581
Because the G at the two points are so close that you will see that you find then that it's approximately MGH, even though it is the difference between these two rather clumsy terms.

362
28:51,391 --> 29:11,221
We will many, many times in the future use the 1/R relationship for gravitational potential energy. We will get very used to the idea that gravitational potential energy is negative everywhere, the way it's defined, and we will get used to the idea that at infinity, the gravitational potential energy is zero.

363
29:11,461 --> 29:28,571
But whenever we deal with near earth situations, like in 26 100, then of course, it is way more convenient to deal with the simplification that the difference in gravitational potential energy is given by MGH.

364
29:28,571 --> 29:35,771
I always remember that MGH, Massachusetts General Hospital, that's the best way that you can remember these simple things.

365
29:36,041 --> 29:41,401
Now, I want to return to the conservation of mechanical energy.

366
29:42,811 --> 29:50,641
I have here a pendulum. I have an object that weighs 15 kg and I can lift it up 1 meter, which I have done now.

367
29:51,191 --> 29:55,401
That means I've done work. MGH is the work I have done, believe me.

368
29:55,941 --> 29:58,751
I've increased the potential energy of this object.

369
29:59,221 --> 30:02,141
15 * 10 is about 150 Joules.

370
30:02,651 --> 30:07,311
If I let it fall, then that will be converted to kinetic energy.

371
30:08,001 --> 30:16,311
If I would let it swing from 1 meter height and you would be there and it would hit you, you'd be dead.

372
30:17,011 --> 30:19,541
150 Joules is enough to kill you.

373
30:20,451 --> 30:26,301
They use these devices, called a wrecking ball, they use them to demolish buildings.

374
30:26,531 --> 30:41,751
You lift up a very heavy object, even heavier than this, and then you let it go, you swing it, thereby converting gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy, and that way you can demolish a building.

375
30:42,151 --> 30:47,911
You just let it hit and it breaks a building.

376
30:47,911 --> 30:50,811
And that's the whole idea of wrecking.

377
30:51,521 --> 30:59,041
So you are using then the conversion of gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy.

378
30:59,881 --> 31:12,341
Now, I am such a strong believer of the conservation of mechanical energy that I am willing to put my life on the line.

379
31:14,211 --> 31:27,711
If I release that bob from a certain height, then that bob can never come back to a point where the height is any larger.

380
31:28,101 --> 31:42,951
If I release it from this height and it swings, then when it reaches here, it could not be higher. There is a conversion from gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy back to gravitational potential energy and it will come to a stop here.

381
31:43,191 --> 31:47,551
And when it swings back, it should not be able to reach any higher.

382
31:47,881 --> 31:54,801
Provided that I do not give this object an initial speed when I stand here.

383
31:55,881 --> 32:01,281
I trust the conservation of mechanical energy for 100%.

384
32:01,961 --> 32:03,861
I may not trust myself.

385
32:05,731 --> 32:16,861
I'm going to release this object and I hope I will be able to do it at zero speed, so that when it comes back, it may touch my chin, but it may not crush my chin.

386
32:17,901 --> 32:22,441
I want you to be extremely quiet because this is no joke.

387
32:23,061 --> 32:28,921
If I don't succeed in giving it zero speed, then this will be my last lecture.

388
32:30,821 --> 32:33,661
I will close my eyes. I don't want to see this.

389
32:34,321 --> 32:36,721
So please be very quiet.

390
32:38,221 --> 32:40,131
I almost didn't sleep all night.

391
32:41,061 --> 32:43,801
Three, two, one, zero.

392
32:50,101 --> 32:59,431
Physics works and I'm still alive.

393
33:00,211 --> 33:01,361
See you Wednesday.

394
33:05,411 --> 33:06,011
