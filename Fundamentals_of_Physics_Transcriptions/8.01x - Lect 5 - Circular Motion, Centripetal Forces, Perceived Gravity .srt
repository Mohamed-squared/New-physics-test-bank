1
00:00:00,728 --> 00:00:05,228
Today we will discuss
what we call uniform

2
00:00:05,228 --> 00:00:11,188
circular motion.

3
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,938
What is uniform circular motion?

4
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:19,948
An object
goes around in a circle.

5
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:23,298
has radius R.

6
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:26,168
When the object is here,

7
00:00:28,188 --> 00:00:31,288
This is the velocity.
It's a vector.

8
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:33,728
perpendicular.

9
00:00:34,478 --> 00:00:37,458
And later in time, when the object is here,

10
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:44,328
The velocity has changed,
but the speed has not changed.

11
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,498
We introduce T, what we call the period.

12
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:51,568
Of course is in seconds.

13
00:00:52,638 --> 00:00:54,758
Which is the time to go around once.

14
00:00:55,848 --> 00:01:01,998
We introduce the frequency F,
which we call the frequency,

15
00:01:03,038 --> 00:01:07,438
which is the number
of rotations per second.

16
00:01:08,258 --> 00:01:14,928
And so the units are either second minus one,
but most physicist would call it Hertz.

17
00:01:15,448 --> 00:01:20,138
And so frequency
is 1 divided by T.

18
00:01:21,728 --> 00:01:27,858
We also introduce
angular velocity Omega,

19
00:01:28,528 --> 00:01:33,428
which we call
angular velocity.

20
00:01:34,758 --> 00:01:40,418
Angular velocity means not how many meters per second,
but how many radians per second.

21
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:54,128
So, since there are 2 pi radians
in one circumference, in one full circle,
and it takes T seconds to go around once,

22
00:01:54,308 --> 00:01:59,808
it is immediately obvious that omega
equals 2 pi divided by T.

23
00:02:00,398 --> 00:02:08,218
This is something that I would like you
to remember, Omega equals 2 pi
divided by T.

24
00:02:10,968 --> 00:02:13,908
2 pi radians in capital T seconds.

25
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:17,998
The speed V

26
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:30,848
is of course the circumference 2 pi r
divided by the time to go around once,
but since 2 pi divided by T is omega,
you can also write for this omega R.

27
00:02:31,638 --> 00:02:34,388
And this is also something
that I want you to remember.

28
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:37,718
These two things
you really want to remember.

29
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:49,358
The speed is not changing,
but the velocity vector is changing.
Therefore, there must be an acceleration
that is non-negotiable.

30
00:02:50,918 --> 00:03:09,408
You can derive what that acceleration
must be in terms of magnitude and in terms of direction.
It's about a five, six minutes derivation.
You find it in your book. I have decided
to give you the results so that you read up on the book,
so that we can more talk about the physics
rather than on the derivation.

31
00:03:10,338 --> 00:03:20,468
This acceleration that is necessary
to make the change in the velocity vector
is always pointing towards the center of the circle.

32
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:24,148
We call it centripetal acceleration.

33
00:03:25,228 --> 00:03:27,668
Centripetal.

34
00:03:28,068 --> 00:03:31,988
Centripetal, pointing towards the center.

35
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:37,788
And here
also pointing towards the center. It's a vector.

36
00:03:38,698 --> 00:03:51,718
And the magnitude
of the centripetal acceleration
equals V squared divided by R, which is this V.
And therefore it's also omega square R.

37
00:03:52,308 --> 00:03:59,908
And so now we have
three equations and those are the only three
you really would like to remember.

38
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:05,809
We can have a simple example.
Uh, let's have a

39
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:14,659
vacuum cleaner which has a rotor inside
which scoops the air out or in, whichever way you look at it.

40
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:20,839
And let's assume that the vacuum cleaner, these scoops
have a radius R of about 10 cm.

41
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:24,669
And that it goes around 600 revolutions per minute.

42
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:26,899
600 RPM.

43
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:34,249
600 RPM would translate into a frequency F
of 10 hertz.

44
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:41,509
So it would translate into a period going around
in 1/10 of a second.

45
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:49,259
So omega, angular velocity,
which is 2 pi divided by T,

46
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:57,029
is then approximately
63 radians per second.

47
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,259
And
the speed V equals omega R

48
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:08,759
is then roughly 6.3 m per second.

49
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:12,819
The centripetal acceleration, and that's really my goal.

50
00:05:13,609 --> 00:05:22,829
The centripetal acceleration would be omega square R,
or if you prefer, you can take V square over R,
you would get the same answer, of course.

51
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:28,829
And you will find
that that is about 400 meters per second square.

52
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:33,209
And that is huge. That is 40 times the acceleration due to gravity.

53
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:37,949
It's a phenomenal acceleration, a simple
vacuum cleaner.

54
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:44,709
Notice that the acceleration, the centripetal acceleration
is linear in R.

55
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,009
Don't think that it is inversely proportional with R.

56
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:55,799
That's a mistake because V itself
is a function of R. If you were sitting here,
then your velocity would be lower.

57
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:15,669
Since omega is the same for the entire
motion, you really have to look at this equation
and you see that the centripetal acceleration
is proportional with R. Therefore, if you were,
if this were a disc which was rotating
and you were at the center of the disc,
the centripetal acceleration would be zero.

58
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:19,669
And as you were to walk out further out, it would increase.

59
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:24,639
Now the acceleration must be caused by something.

60
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:27,739
There is no such thing as a free lunch.

61
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:34,059
There is something that must be responsible
for the change in this velocity.

62
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:38,879
And that something I will call either a pull,
or I will call it a push.

63
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:44,749
Now next lecture, when we deal with Newton's laws,
we will introduce the word force.

64
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:49,729
Today, we will only deal with the words
pull and push.

65
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:54,199
So there must be a pull or a push.

66
00:06:54,819 --> 00:07:02,779
Imagine that this is a turntable
and you are sitting here on the turntable on a chair.

67
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:11,039
It's going around with angular
velocity omega, and your distance to the center,
let's say is little R.

68
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:26,699
You're sitting on this chair
and you must experience that is non-negotiable,
um centripetal acceleration,
A of C, which is omega square * R.

69
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:28,979
Where do you get it from?

70
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:37,929
Well, if you if your seat is bolted to the
to the turntable, then you will feel a push
in your back.

71
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:43,669
So you're sitting on this thing, you're going around,
and you will feel that the seat is pushing you in your back.

72
00:07:44,609 --> 00:07:47,029
And so you feel a push.

73
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:49,189
And let's give the push.

74
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:56,549
Yeah, I I can give this a
red color for now. So you'll feel a push
in your back.

75
00:07:57,489 --> 00:08:02,169
That push, apparently, is necessary
for the acceleration.

76
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:06,679
Alternatively,
suppose you had in front of you a stick.

77
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:12,189
You're not sitting on a chair, you don't get a push from your back,
but you hold on to this stick.

78
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:16,839
And now you can go around by holding on to the stick.

79
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:20,639
Now the stick is pulling on you in this same direction.

80
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:24,229
So now you would say, aha, someone is pulling on you.

81
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,719
Whether it is the pull or whether it is the push.

82
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:38,999
One of the either one of the two is necessary
for you to go around
in that circle on that turntable with that
constant speed.

83
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:50,949
Now the classic question comes up,
which we often ask to people who have no scientific background,
if you were to go around like this,

84
00:08:51,689 --> 00:09:00,939
and something is either pushing on you or is pulling on you
to make this possible, suppose you took that push
out all of a sudden, the pool is gone.

85
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:05,699
What is now the motion
of the person who is sitting on the term table?

86
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:10,579
And many non-scientists say, well, it will do like this.

87
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:12,739
That's sort of what your intuition says.

88
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:19,049
You go around in a circle, and all of a sudden
you no longer have the pull or the push, and you
go around in a spiral.

89
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:21,949
And obviously that is not the case.

90
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:34,289
What will happen is if you have at this moment in time
a velocity in this direction
and you take the pull or the push out,
you will start flying off in that direction.

91
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:46,549
And depending upon whether there is gravity or no gravity,
there may be a change, but if this were
if there were no gravity, would just continue to go
along that line and you would not make this crazy spiral motion.

92
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:55,059
I have here a disc
which we will rotate and at the end,
the edge of the disc here, we have a little
ball.

93
00:09:55,369 --> 00:09:59,239
And the ball is attached to that
disc with a string.

94
00:09:59,829 --> 01:01,809
So now this is vertical,

95
01:02,599 --> 01:05,419
and so this is going to go around with angular velocity omega.

96
01:06,069 --> 01:07,529
And we have a string here.

97
01:08,299 --> 01:10,849
And the string is attached to this ball.

98
01:11,529 --> 01:12,959
And the whole thing is going around.

99
01:13,919 --> 01:18,089
And so at one moment in time,
this has a velocity, like so.

100
01:18,939 --> 01:27,439
And therefore there must be non-negotiable
centripetal acceleration, which in magnitude
is omega square R.

101
01:28,199 --> 01:31,289
Or, if you want to, V square divided by R.

102
01:34,349 --> 01:36,819
Now, I cut it.

103
01:37,239 --> 01:39,819
And that's like taking away the push and the pull.

104
01:40,389 --> 01:44,549
The string that you have here
is providing the pool on this ball.

105
01:45,479 --> 01:51,339
This ball is feeling
a pull from the string and that provides it with the centripetal acceleration.

106
01:52,129 --> 01:59,599
Cut the string and the pool
is gone and the object will
take off.

107
02:00,179 --> 02:05,859
And if there were gravity here, as there is in 26 100,
it would become a parabola and it would end up here.

108
02:06,429 --> 02:19,769
If, however, I cut the ball
exactly when it is here, not the ball, but I cut the string,
then of course, it would fly straight up,
gravity would act on it, would come to a hold, and it would come back.

109
02:20,189 --> 02:22,269
So really would then go along a straight line.

110
02:22,839 --> 02:29,199
But you would clearly see then that it's not going to do what many people think
that it would start to swirl around.

111
02:29,449 --> 02:31,719
It just goes and comes back.

112
02:32,359 --> 02:33,819
Let's look at that. We have that here.

113
02:34,779 --> 02:35,729
So here is that ball.

114
02:35,839 --> 02:38,789
The string is behind here, you cannot see the string.

115
02:39,579 --> 02:40,829
I will rotate it.

116
02:42,059 --> 02:44,829
Wait for it to pick up a little speed.

117
02:45,709 --> 02:49,189
And the knife that you can't see either is behind here.

118
02:49,679 --> 02:58,039
And when I
push the knife in, I do it exactly here,
it cuts the string and it goes up.

119
02:59,309 --> 03:00,919
Are you ready for this?

120
03:01,719 --> 03:02,919
You sure you're ready?

121
03:03,509 --> 03:05,599
3, 2, 1, 0.

122
03:06,549 --> 03:07,019
Wow.

123
03:07,499 --> 03:18,899
That was very high. So you see, there's nothing like this.
It simply continued on in the direction that it was going.
It wasn't going into a parabola because I was shooting it
straight up.

124
03:22,579 --> 03:28,759
The string forms the connection
between the rotating disc and the ball.

125
03:29,259 --> 03:34,279
And therefore
the pull is responsible for the centripetal acceleration.

126
03:35,319 --> 03:37,989
Let's now think about
planets.

127
03:39,239 --> 03:40,989
Planets go around the sun.

128
03:42,409 --> 03:43,679
There is no string.

129
03:44,899 --> 03:47,669
So, who is pushing? Who is pulling?

130
03:48,549 --> 03:49,669
Well, it's clear.

131
03:50,879 --> 03:56,579
That it must be gravity. It must be the sun
that is pulling on the planets.

132
03:57,819 --> 04:03,939
Now, I realized that the orbits of planets
are not nicely circular, so it's not really a uniform circular motion.

133
04:04,589 --> 04:09,989
We will deal with orbits in great detail
in a few weeks, circular orbits and elliptical orbits.

134
04:10,789 --> 04:19,859
Let us just assume for simplicity now
that the orbits are roughly
circular just to get a little bit of feeling for it.

135
04:20,209 --> 04:27,629
And you can look up now in your book,
which I did for you, even in your
preliminary version, you can look up

136
04:28,349 --> 04:37,719
what the mean distance of the planets is to the sun,
and you can look up what the period is, the time to go around the sun.

137
04:38,696 --> 04:44,706
The time to go around the sun is not the same for all planets.
The planets are not attached to a turntable.

138
04:45,576 --> 04:48,936
Anywhere any person on a turntable would go around in the same amount of time.

139
04:49,286 --> 04:51,216
We know that that's not true for planets.

140
04:51,656 --> 04:56,786
It takes the earth a year to go around
the sun, it takes Jupiter 12 years to go around.

141
04:56,936 --> 05:01,866
So don't make the mistake to think
that omega is the same for all planets.

142
05:02,216 --> 05:03,066
That's not true.

143
05:04,316 --> 05:11,346
So, I look up the distance,
the mean distance to these various planets.

144
05:12,166 --> 05:15,826
And you see that here in millions of kilometers.

145
05:16,286 --> 05:20,846
Notice that Mercury is about 100 times closer than Pluto.

146
05:21,156 --> 05:25,116
By the way, this is on the web, so don't copy this.
You'll find this on the 801 homepage.

147
05:25,876 --> 05:33,856
Then I've I looked up how many years it takes to go around the sun,
12 years for Jupiter, 1 year for the Earth,
and I looked up all the other value values.

148
05:34,616 --> 05:39,736
Then, since I know the period,
I can calculate omega. Omega is 2 pi divided by t.

149
05:40,526 --> 05:41,816
So I know omega.

150
05:42,296 --> 05:49,886
And then I take omega square times the mean distance to the sun,
and this is of course the centripetal acceleration.

151
05:50,786 --> 05:56,436
So the planets experience this centripetal acceleration
in some crazy units, but who cares about the units here?

152
05:57,106 --> 06:10,766
And notice that Mercury, which is 100 times closer than Pluto,
has an centripetal acceleration which is 10,000 times larger
than Pluto.

153
06:11,196 --> 06:16,256
100 times closer has a 10,000 times larger
centripetal acceleration.

154
06:17,046 --> 06:24,106
So what I did was I plotted this data,
the centripetal acceleration versus the mean distance to the sun.

155
06:24,366 --> 06:26,416
And I did that on log log paper.

156
06:27,466 --> 06:39,616
And what immediately
strikes is very striking is
that all these points, I've done them for all the planets,
they fall on a straight line.

157
06:41,386 --> 06:43,766
And so, what is the slope of that line?

158
06:44,636 --> 06:54,406
Well, I tried various slopes
and I found that the slope is very, very close
to minus two.

159
06:55,306 --> 06:58,256
Here is a slope of minus two.

160
06:59,766 --> 07:07,416
And I can overlay this
and notice that the fit is absolutely
stunning.

161
07:08,816 --> 07:21,426
Therefore, you cannot escape
the conclusion that the centripetal acceleration,
which is the result of gravity, falls off
as 1/ R squared.

162
07:22,576 --> 07:27,596
We refer to this often in physics as the 1/ R square law.

163
07:28,146 --> 07:34,566
And therefore the effect of gravity itself
must go down with our squared.

164
07:35,356 --> 07:49,856
So if you are 100 times further away
like Pluto compared to Mercury, then
the gravitational the centripetal acceleration,
which is due to gravity is 10,000 times smaller.

165
07:52,996 --> 07:55,356
And we will learn a lot about gravity in the future.

166
07:55,996 --> 07:57,566
We will just leave it for now.

167
07:57,966 --> 08:11,316
If you took the sun away,
it would be like cutting the string
that provides the pool and
in that case, what you would see
is that the planets would just take off along a straight line.

168
08:12,076 --> 08:16,466
They would continue to go. They wouldn't have anything to
pull on them anymore.

169
08:18,646 --> 08:24,426
Now, let's look at
an object that we're going to rotate.

170
08:25,406 --> 08:32,556
Uh I have a glass tube
that I want to rotate and in the glass tube,
I have a marble.

171
08:34,716 --> 08:36,856
The glass tube is very smooth.

172
08:38,776 --> 08:40,136
I have here the glass tube.

173
08:42,526 --> 08:43,726
Here is a marble.

174
08:46,186 --> 08:48,116
I'm going to rotate it in this direction.

175
08:51,276 --> 08:55,286
say with some angular velocity omega about an axis perpendicular to the blackboard.

176
08:56,006 --> 09:03,676
So the
the marble here
has a velocity like so at this moment in time.

177
09:04,566 --> 09:06,636
But it's a very smooth glass tube.

178
09:07,506 --> 09:08,946
And the marble is very smooth.

179
09:10,296 --> 09:16,026
The glass cannot push on the marble,
nor can the glass pull on the marble.

180
09:17,116 --> 09:28,786
Now the marble gets desperate because the marble
needs a centripetal acceleration
in this direction in order to go around like this.

181
09:29,166 --> 09:32,566
But there is nothing to provide that centripetal acceleration.

182
09:32,916 --> 09:41,806
So the marble is doing exactly the same that the planets would do,
if you take the sun away, the marble continues to go
in the direction that it was going.

183
09:42,166 --> 09:49,186
So by the time that the tube is here,
the marble is here.

184
09:49,936 --> 09:55,566
And by the time that the tube is here,
the marble is there.

185
09:56,106 --> 10:04,886
So the marble finds its way
to the edge. And that's of course
the basic idea behind
a centrifuge.

186
10:06,806 --> 10:08,866
My grandmother had always

187
10:09,206 --> 10:12,876
She was a great lady, and she had such fantastic ideas, I remember.

188
10:13,476 --> 10:19,486
And when she made lettuce, we had no
good way of drying the lettuce.

189
10:19,866 --> 10:23,596
And I would take the lettuce and
go like this.

190
10:24,326 --> 10:25,466
Paper towel.

191
10:26,136 --> 10:27,876
She had a method of her own.

192
10:29,046 --> 10:30,866
She took the collinder.

193
10:31,836 --> 10:36,456
And of course, first of all,
we would wash the lettuce. That goes without saying.

194
10:36,976 --> 10:42,356
I would wash it once. My grandmother would wash it
three times, but that's what you have grandmothers for.

195
10:43,626 --> 10:46,856
So, there comes the the lettuce.

196
10:47,076 --> 10:52,426
We were also very fond of spinach.
So, add some spinach.

197
10:53,016 --> 10:54,636
We would wash it.

198
10:55,856 --> 10:56,926
There goes the spinach.

199
10:57,896 --> 11:03,866
Then she would take something to cover it up,
maybe some Saran wrap or something else.

200
11:06,046 --> 11:07,886
Put it over it.

201
11:08,386 --> 11:13,726
and put
a rubber band around it to hold it.

202
11:14,856 --> 11:24,206
And now what she's going to do, she's going to swing it around.
And now the water is like these
marbles. The water will work its way to the edge,

203
11:24,776 --> 11:27,466
but there are holes. So the water will come out.

204
11:28,256 --> 11:29,306
Isn't she clever?

205
11:30,596 --> 11:38,986
Okay, I'll give you a demonstration.
Be careful because you may get
some water on your lecture notes.

206
11:39,256 --> 11:42,606
But I want to show you the the basic idea behind it. It's very interesting.

207
11:42,976 --> 11:47,456
So she would go out, she would do this outside by the way.
But I have no choice, so we'll do it here.

208
11:47,806 --> 11:48,796
So, there we go.

209
11:53,816 --> 11:54,196
See?

210
11:55,086 --> 12:00,116
This is the way you dry.

211
12:01,266 --> 12:05,246
Oh, I lost my magnetic strawberry.
That's a detail in the process.

212
12:05,716 --> 12:14,266
So, you end up with
you end up with dry and clean
and nice lettuce.

213
12:16,056 --> 12:17,806
This is 801 at work.

214
12:18,326 --> 12:22,376
And this is clearly an early version of
a centrifuge.

215
12:23,366 --> 12:32,456
Now, my grandmother's method very tragically
has been replaced lately
with something that you can buy at Crate and Barrel.

216
12:33,006 --> 12:34,036
We have it here.

217
12:36,306 --> 12:38,726
Um it is very boring.

218
12:39,336 --> 12:40,436
It's very decadent.

219
12:41,036 --> 12:42,006
Put the salad in here.

220
12:42,516 --> 12:47,466
And all you do is you rotate
and it dries.

221
12:47,716 --> 12:48,606
It's a centrifuge.

222
12:48,606 --> 12:55,076
This this is actually a high-tech version
of the much more sophisticated invention of my grandmother.

223
12:55,656 --> 12:59,136
And and it's nowhere nearly as exciting.

224
13:00,156 --> 13:05,806
The days of romance are really over.
But that's the way it goes.

225
13:06,956 --> 13:17,506
I'm now going to make
a connection between rotation on the one hand
and centripetal acceleration on the other.

226
13:19,296 --> 13:28,336
I'm going to make a connection
between centripetal acceleration
and perceived gravity.

227
13:29,046 --> 13:32,856
The way that you perceive gravity.

228
13:33,516 --> 13:38,836
I'm going to put you in various positions and then ask you
what is the direction of gravity?

229
13:39,236 --> 13:41,836
I'm going to create artificial gravity for you.

230
13:42,866 --> 13:44,816
And let's first do it as follows.

231
13:46,086 --> 13:48,636
I first hang you on a string.

232
13:50,646 --> 13:51,546
There you are.

233
13:53,866 --> 13:54,856
Like this.

234
13:56,816 --> 13:59,246
And I ask you, do you feel a push or a pull?

235
13:59,796 --> 14:03,496
And you say, yeah, I feel a pull.

236
14:04,576 --> 14:06,666
And you feel a pull in this direction.

237
14:09,846 --> 14:11,406
So now I ask you, ah,"

238
14:12,266 --> 14:16,856
in what direction do you perceive gravity?

239
14:17,926 --> 14:19,616
And you think I'm crazy."

240
14:19,966 --> 14:27,626
You're right in that case, but nevertheless,
you say, gravity is in this direction,
the other direction as the pool.

241
14:28,436 --> 14:30,386
Okay, so far so good."

242
14:30,966 --> 14:35,976
So now I'm going to put you just standing on the floor."

243
14:36,676 --> 14:39,346
And I say to you, do you feel a push or a pull?"

244
14:39,956 --> 14:42,436
And you say, yeah, I feel a push."

245
14:43,176 --> 14:46,476
I feel a push from the floor up."

246
14:47,026 --> 14:51,236
So I say, in what direction do you perceive gravity?"

247
14:51,766 --> 14:56,656
You say, well, come on, don't be boring.
Gravity is in this direction."

248
14:57,476 --> 15:06,206
Notice in both cases, you tell me
that gravity is always in the opposite direction
of either your pull or your push."

249
15:07,626 --> 15:08,506
Okay."

250
15:09,806 --> 15:13,566
Now I'm going to be a little rough on you."

251
15:14,426 --> 15:17,406
Now I'm going to swing you around on a string."

252
15:18,066 --> 15:19,656
Just as if you were an apple."

253
15:20,076 --> 15:21,946
And I'm going to do this with you."

254
15:22,756 --> 15:24,186
And you're at the end of the apple."

255
15:24,666 --> 15:27,926
You are the apple, not at the end,
you're the end of the string, you are the apple."

256
15:29,446 --> 15:31,066
So, there you are."

257
15:31,846 --> 15:32,266
Here."

258
15:34,906 --> 15:35,756
Poor you."

259
15:39,766 --> 15:43,826
And I say, do you feel a push or a pull?"

260
15:44,006 --> 15:46,466
And you say, yeah, I do. I feel a pull."

261
15:46,946 --> 15:47,946
Fine, in what direction?"

262
15:48,556 --> 15:51,326
I feel a pull in this direction."

263
15:51,856 --> 15:52,746
Okay."

264
15:53,916 --> 15:58,566
So now I say to you,
in what direction do you perceive gravity?"

265
15:58,856 --> 16:01,976
And you say, oh, in the opposite direction as pull."

266
16:02,346 --> 16:09,146
So now you perceive gravity
in this direction, which is very real for you."

267
16:09,996 --> 16:17,416
Now, in this particular case,
since the direction changes all the time,
since I swirl you around,"

268
16:17,906 --> 16:20,816
you will of course get dizzy like hell, but that's a detail."

269
16:21,726 --> 16:28,696
You will perceive gravity in this direction when you hear,
and when you hear, you will perceive gravity in that direction."

270
16:30,236 --> 16:44,906
So you perceive gravity in the
direction which is opposing the pull.
And the faster I rotate you, the stronger will be the pull,
and therefore, the stronger will be your perceived gravity."

271
16:46,846 --> 16:48,086
A carpenter"

272
16:49,816 --> 16:51,146
would use a plum line."

273
16:52,076 --> 16:54,716
And the carpenter would just hold the plum line like this."

274
16:55,596 --> 16:56,966
The pool is in this direction."

275
16:57,686 --> 17:01,686
And so the carpenter says, okay, perceived gravity is in that direction."

276
17:02,066 --> 17:04,966
The carpenter happens to be right in this case."

277
17:05,166 --> 17:06,926
Gravity is in this direction, but it's the same idea."

278
17:07,336 --> 17:11,346
The plum line is being used to find the direction of gravity."

279
17:11,686 --> 17:20,376
Think of this as being a plum line.
Find used to define the direction of gravity."

280
17:22,436 --> 17:24,846
Now you're in outer space."

281
17:25,896 --> 17:27,366
You're going to play Captain Kirk."

282
17:28,196 --> 17:33,796
And you're in a space station
and there is no gravity."

283
17:34,446 --> 17:36,626
So, we're going to make some gravity for you."

284
17:36,986 --> 17:39,256
We're going to create some artificial gravity."

285
17:40,176 --> 17:46,066
So let this be your space station. It's a big wheel."

286
17:46,846 --> 17:50,976
A radius of about 100 meters."

287
17:51,816 --> 17:54,016
And we'll make it very fancy for you."

288
17:54,606 --> 18:01,896
We'll make some corridors
around like here."

289
18:03,336 --> 18:07,166
We'll make it a very interesting space station."

290
18:07,456 --> 18:11,126
Like so, and like so."

291
18:12,126 --> 18:17,626
And this is rotating around with angular velocity omega."

292
18:19,136 --> 18:20,086
You're here."

293
18:21,216 --> 18:22,196
There you are."

294
18:24,866 --> 18:26,156
You go around."

295
18:26,746 --> 18:27,806
Therefore,"

296
18:28,216 --> 18:29,256
non-negotiable."

297
18:30,036 --> 18:37,176
You're going around with a certain velocity V.
This V equals omega R."

298
18:37,736 --> 18:42,676
And therefore, you require a centripetal acceleration towards the center."

299
18:42,946 --> 18:43,876
That is non-negotiable."

300
18:44,946 --> 18:46,316
Where do you get it from?"

301
18:46,936 --> 18:51,056
Well, the floor, this is your floor, is pushing on you."

302
18:51,576 --> 18:54,246
As simple as that. Just like the floor is pushing on me now."

303
18:54,916 --> 18:56,596
This floor is pushing, there's nothing wrong with that."

304
18:57,156 --> 18:58,556
I don't fall over."

305
18:59,276 --> 19:03,456
And so I say to you, in what direction do you perceive gravity?"

306
19:03,856 --> 19:07,796
And you say, this is the direction of gravity."

307
19:08,386 --> 19:11,006
Which is as real for you as it can be."

308
19:11,806 --> 19:14,466
Someone else is standing here."

309
19:17,706 --> 19:22,566
What do you think that person will think if I ask that person, what is the direction of gravity?"

310
19:23,756 --> 19:26,606
Exactly, radially outwards."

311
19:27,086 --> 19:30,436
Opposing the push from the floor."

312
19:33,316 --> 19:46,896
So we could now calculate how fast we have to rotate this spaceship
to mimic the gravitational acceleration on Earth, which is 9.8 ms per second square. Let's call that 10 just to round it off a little."

313
19:47,846 --> 19:56,816
So we want the people who walk around in this corridor
to have an acceleration omega square R, which is about 10."

314
19:58,266 --> 20:01,876
So omega squared is about 0.1."

315
20:03,126 --> 20:09,056
So omega is about 0.3 radians per second."

316
20:11,156 --> 20:18,256
And so the period to go around
is about 2 pi divided by omega."

317
20:18,706 --> 20:21,726
And that is about 20 seconds."

318
20:23,896 --> 20:35,556
And the tangential speed, that value for V,
which is omega R, would then be 0.3
times 100, would be about 30 ms per second."

319
20:36,106 --> 20:40,676
Just to give you an idea for these numbers, which are by no means
so ridiculous."

320
20:42,586 --> 20:52,076
What is interesting that the perceived gravity and dus
and therefore the centripetal acceleration is zero here."

321
20:53,886 --> 20:55,306
There's nothing."

322
20:55,746 --> 20:56,986
There's no gravity there."

323
20:57,666 --> 21:01,656
And so that may be a good place for you to have your sleeping quarters."

324
21:03,116 --> 21:04,536
Now comes an interesting question."

325
21:05,546 --> 21:08,046
You can walk around here without any problem."

326
21:10,016 --> 21:13,626
Could you walk into these spokes?"

327
21:14,296 --> 21:20,946
So when you were here, could you then
walk towards your sleeping quarters?"

328
21:21,466 --> 21:25,836
So you're standing here, and I first ask you, in what direction is gravity?"

329
21:26,196 --> 21:28,266
And you will say, well gravity is in this direction."

330
21:28,926 --> 21:31,756
Can you now walk to your sleeping quarters?"

331
21:32,206 --> 21:33,216
And what's the answer?"

332
21:33,986 --> 21:34,856
You cannot."

333
21:35,716 --> 21:37,536
You cannot walk up against gravity."

334
21:38,006 --> 21:40,496
It would be like asking you to walk to the ceiling."

335
21:40,966 --> 21:44,416
How do you do that? An elevator or a staircase? That's fine."

336
21:44,996 --> 21:47,876
Because then you get the push from the stairs when you step on the stairs."

337
21:48,336 --> 21:52,466
So you could have a staircase here, and that's the way this person could go here."

338
21:53,046 --> 21:54,936
But you cannot simply walk here."

339
21:55,406 --> 21:57,626
Because gravity is always in this direction."

340
21:58,666 --> 22:10,986
Now let's suppose you are to sleeping quarters
and you wake up in the morning
and you decide to go back either in this direction or this direction or this direction or that direction, doesn't matter."

341
22:12,286 --> 22:21,926
Could you do that just by just going into this corridor
and slowly, carefully starting moving?
What would happen?"

342
22:23,226 --> 22:23,426
Yeah?"

343
22:24,706 --> 22:25,976
Fly out."

344
22:26,606 --> 22:27,676
Would be suicide."

345
22:28,366 --> 22:42,106
Because the moment that you're here,
already, you have maybe not a very large
gravity gravitational experience, but already
it's beginning to grow on you, the farther out you are,
the stronger it will be."

346
22:42,386 --> 22:51,116
By the time you hear this 10 meters per second square,
remember we had 10 meters per second square because we wanted to mimic the earth."

347
22:51,396 --> 22:54,156
And so you literally crash, it's like falling into a shaft."

348
22:55,036 --> 23:04,366
Jumping into a shaft. It's not quite the same
because you start off with no pull on you.
The moment you start going, however, the situation gets out of hand
and indeed, you will slam."

349
23:04,606 --> 23:10,166
So you can use the same elevator,
you can use the same staircase. There's nothing wrong with that."

350
23:12,426 --> 23:22,826
Suppose I have a liquid
which has very, very fine
small particles in it, extremely small."

351
23:24,216 --> 23:29,286
So small and so light
that they will not sink to the bottom."

352
23:30,776 --> 23:36,496
So you always see some colored milky type
liquid."

353
23:37,406 --> 23:39,636
And here is that tube,"

354
23:40,736 --> 23:43,576
which has these fine particles."

355
23:45,386 --> 23:49,836
And the tube is sitting there
and the line of the liquid is obviously like this."

356
23:50,196 --> 23:51,156
Why?"

357
23:51,806 --> 23:55,856
Well, that's obvious because gravity is in this direction."

358
23:57,096 --> 24:00,366
And so the surface of a liquid is always perpendicular to gravity."

359
24:00,986 --> 24:05,506
You see here two glasses with water,
the surface is perpendicular to gravity."

360
24:06,286 --> 24:11,966
Now, I'm going to rotate this
about this this axis, going around like this."

361
24:13,546 --> 24:20,706
And I'm going to rotate it with an angular velocity omega.
This is at a distance R."

362
24:21,396 --> 24:28,356
Therefore, there is now
a centripetal acceleration in this direction."

363
24:29,026 --> 24:35,686
And so the particles now say,
aha, gravity is in this direction."

364
24:36,486 --> 24:43,276
This side of the glass and the liquid
is pushing in this direction to provide this centripetal acceleration."

365
24:44,186 --> 24:47,896
So if you ask them where is gravity, they will say gravity is there."

366
24:48,536 --> 24:55,966
And this gravitational effect can be so much stronger than this one,
that you can forget this one."

367
24:56,086 --> 24:57,986
You'll see that in a minute.
You can completely forget this one."

368
24:58,286 --> 25:04,226
And so the liquid will say,
I'm going to be perpendicular to gravity."

369
25:04,576 --> 25:07,196
And so the liquid will go like this, clunk."

370
25:08,036 --> 25:12,846
While it rotates around, the liquid in this tilted tube will be vertical."

371
25:13,776 --> 25:14,826
But not only that,"

372
25:16,016 --> 25:21,256
the particles that are here experience now
way stronger gravity than they did before."

373
25:21,576 --> 25:28,886
So I have made them heavier. They're no longer light particles, they are heavy particles."

374
25:29,076 --> 25:34,656
And what do heavy particles do? They have no problems
in making it to the side."

375
25:34,886 --> 25:47,456
The reason why the light particles couldn't fall in the first place
has to do with the fact that the molecules of the liquid
due to their temperature have a chaotic motion."

376
25:47,456 --> 25:48,656
We call that the thermal agitation."

377
25:48,656 --> 25:54,986
And these molecules would interact with these very small and light particles.
And so the light particles would never make it to the bottom."

378
25:55,756 --> 26:08,746
The thermal agitation now of the liquid is the same.
The temperature doesn't change, but the particles have become way, way heavier.
And so the particles now go in the direction of gravity, which is here."

379
26:09,676 --> 26:18,436
And what you will see, if these particles are white, you will see white
precipitation there and the liquid will become clear."

380
26:19,566 --> 26:33,166
And that is something that I would like to demonstrate to you,
but before I do that, I want to give you some numbers.
Here we have a household simple, nothing special
centrifuge that is used in any laboratory."

381
26:34,156 --> 26:44,056
The centrifuge that we have
has a RPM, which is 6 3600 RPM."

382
26:45,526 --> 26:56,286
So 3600 RPM translates into a frequency
of 60 Hz. So it goes around
once in 1/60th of a second."

383
26:56,796 --> 27:01,846
Omega is 2 pi times F."

384
27:02,406 --> 27:07,016
is therefore roughly 360 radians per second."

385
27:07,936 --> 27:10,416
360 radians per second."

386
27:12,496 --> 27:21,886
Uh if we assume that the radius is uh
maybe it's 10, 15 cm, whatever,
let's take a radius of 15 cm."

387
27:22,516 --> 27:32,006
And we can calculate now what the centripetal acceleration is,
and the centripetal acceleration A of C,
which is omega squared R,"

388
27:32,626 --> 27:38,186
is then roughly about 20,000 m per second squared."

389
27:38,726 --> 27:42,606
20,000 ms per second squared."

390
27:44,626 --> 27:50,526
And that is 2,000 times the gravitational acceleration."

391
27:51,426 --> 28:00,966
It means that these particles experience
gravity which is 2,000 times stronger
than if I don't rotate them."

392
28:01,826 --> 28:04,516
And so, they will go to the side here."

393
28:05,736 --> 28:09,546
But the glass itself is also 2,000 times heavier."

394
28:10,106 --> 28:16,526
And therefore, the glass can easily break. So when you design a centrifuge like that,
you have to really think that through very carefully."

395
28:17,166 --> 28:20,836
That the pieces that are in there don't
fly apart."

396
28:24,416 --> 28:33,756
I have here water in which I have dissolved some
table salt. Same table salt that you use in the kitchen
when you prepare your food."

397
28:34,916 --> 28:36,796
Table salt in here."

398
28:37,826 --> 28:43,796
Here, I have water in which I
dissolved some silver nitrate."

399
28:44,456 --> 28:46,586
It's it's nasty stuff."

400
28:47,126 --> 28:49,326
I warn you for it, you have to be very careful."

401
28:49,886 --> 29:00,836
Because if you get the stuff on your hands,
it burns through your hands very quickly without you realizing it
and you end up with a very black spot. It really eats away,
burns out your skin."

402
29:01,156 --> 29:07,416
People put it on wards and then the wards they think fall off.
probably do after a while, but your finger may also fall off."

403
29:08,506 --> 29:13,696
So, I have here silver nitrate and there I have
uh sodium chloride."

404
29:14,566 --> 29:19,636
And I
mix the two."

405
29:20,016 --> 29:26,166
So I get table salt, sodium chloride,
plus silver nitrate."

406
29:27,286 --> 29:34,656
gives sodium nitrate
plus silver chloride."

407
29:34,856 --> 29:42,836
And this very small white particles,
and you will see that the liquid turns
milky instantaneously."

408
29:43,136 --> 29:46,406
It almost becomes like
like yogurt as you will see."

409
29:47,116 --> 29:49,636
And so I want to show that to you."

410
29:51,276 --> 29:57,576
I have here these two glasses. This is the
table salt and this is the silver nitrate."

411
29:59,126 --> 30:01,096
I'm going to mix them."

412
30:04,376 --> 30:05,856
I hope you can see this."

413
30:06,706 --> 30:07,826
Here are the two glasses."

414
30:08,546 --> 30:11,836
And when I mix them,"

415
30:12,976 --> 30:14,586
instantaneously you get milk."

416
30:17,716 --> 30:18,486
Yeah."

417
30:20,336 --> 30:23,546
I'm not asking you to taste it, but
look at it."

418
30:24,056 --> 30:24,616
Right?"

419
30:25,070 --> 30:25,416
Yeah."

420
30:25,706 --> 30:26,116
Just milk."

421
30:26,456 --> 30:31,166
And you can leave this for hours and hours and hours
and it will just stay like that."

422
30:31,546 --> 30:35,706
Very small particles of silver chloride
are in here."

423
30:36,356 --> 30:40,696
So now we're going to put this
in the centrifuge."

424
30:41,226 --> 30:45,616
I have to put it in a very small tube."

425
30:46,136 --> 30:50,586
I'll show you this small tube. There's no way that I can pour that in
without making a mess."

426
30:51,296 --> 30:52,456
Here's this small tube."

427
30:53,256 --> 30:56,996
And so what I will do is I will first put it in a
small beaker."

428
30:59,866 --> 31:07,886
And then from this small beaker,
I will transfer it, some of it
to this tube."

429
31:08,546 --> 31:22,966
When you put this in the centrifuge,
the force on this glass is so high
that you must always make sure that you balance it
with another tube that you fill with water on the other side,
otherwise the thing begins to shake like crazy."

430
31:23,326 --> 31:27,836
It's like your
your centrifuge when you dry your towels."

431
31:28,616 --> 31:34,366
If they are not equally distributed,
it begins to make very obscene sounds and starts to move."

432
31:35,116 --> 31:36,626
And the same thing will happen here."

433
31:37,016 --> 31:43,776
So you just have to take my word for it
that we have put on the other side just some water
to balance it out."

434
31:44,406 --> 31:54,546
So here is now the yogurt
and on the other side is plain water and we'll just let it sit there for a while
and we will return to that shortly."

435
31:58,646 --> 32:00,776
I mentioned already you centrifuge for your clothes."

436
32:01,476 --> 32:07,156
That is the way that you can dry your clothes.
That is the same way that my grandmother dried the lettuce."

437
32:07,416 --> 32:10,966
The water will go to the circumference."

438
32:11,906 --> 32:28,616
A household centrifuge for your clothes would easily rotate 1,200
revolutions per minute, have a radius maybe of 15 cm,
which would give you a centripetal acceleration
of 200 times G, 200 times the gravitational acceleration."

439
32:28,906 --> 32:40,676
So your clothes experience gravity, which is 200 times stronger,
and therefore your clothes are 200 times heavier,
and therefore your clothes can tear apart."

440
32:41,146 --> 32:47,676
And we have all seen that. We've all put in stuff in a centrifuge
and when you take it out, you're disappointed because it's torn."

441
32:47,956 --> 32:52,356
That's because of the tremendous gravity that you have
exposed them to."

442
32:52,936 --> 32:56,836
Many times when I take my shirts out,
half my buttons are gone."

443
32:57,166 --> 33:03,936
That's because the force, I shouldn't use that word,
the gravitational effect on the buttons is enormous."

444
33:04,426 --> 33:06,576
And they just get ripped off."

445
33:07,896 --> 33:19,806
Now, I want to revisit the situation
that you are on the end of my string,
and I'm going to swirl you around."

446
33:20,366 --> 33:27,656
Earlier, I swirl you around like this,
and you didn't like it, and I don't blame you because you got dizzy."

447
33:28,116 --> 33:30,416
Now I'm going to rotate you like this."

448
33:31,056 --> 33:32,506
You may like that better."

449
33:33,746 --> 33:34,826
Maybe not."

450
33:36,636 --> 33:39,386
And so, whether you like it or not,"

451
33:40,296 --> 33:44,236
I'm going to twirl you around and here you are."

452
33:47,646 --> 33:48,876
This is the circle."

453
33:49,536 --> 33:50,916
There is a string."

454
33:51,356 --> 33:52,076
You're here."

455
33:53,036 --> 33:53,786
Here's the string."

456
33:56,566 --> 33:57,466
And there you are."

457
33:59,166 --> 34:01,236
You have a certain velocity."

458
34:02,186 --> 34:04,436
The velocity is in this direction."

459
34:07,596 --> 34:11,516
And there is a certain distance to the center, R."

460
34:13,636 --> 34:21,826
And so you need a certain centripetal acceleration
to go around in that curve."

461
34:22,466 --> 34:24,946
So you need a centripetal acceleration."

462
34:25,446 --> 34:31,116
A of C, which is you can take the V squared divided by R
if you like that."

463
34:31,436 --> 34:32,936
This is the magnitude of that V."

464
34:34,216 --> 34:37,866
Now follow me very closely."

465
34:38,856 --> 34:50,726
Just imagine that this number
happens to be exactly 9.8.
I can always do that."

466
34:52,376 --> 35:01,916
Where is this person
going to get the push or the pull from
for this centripetal acceleration."

467
35:02,556 --> 35:04,886
Does the string have to pull on it?"

468
35:05,436 --> 35:06,006
No."

469
35:06,326 --> 35:11,766
Because there's always gravity,
and gravity gives you an acceleration of 9.8 meters per second squared."

470
35:12,506 --> 35:16,246
So the string says, tough luck, I don't have to do anything."

471
35:17,956 --> 35:26,706
Gravity provides me with the 9.8
meters per second square that I required."

472
35:27,866 --> 35:36,816
Now, I'm going to swing you faster.
So the V will go up, and so the centripetal acceleration will go up."

473
35:38,306 --> 35:44,306
The string will say, aha, I'm going to pull now
on this person."

474
35:44,856 --> 35:48,956
Because the gravitational acceleration alone is not enough.
I need some extra pull."

475
35:49,406 --> 35:53,476
So the string is going to tighten
and pull on you."

476
35:53,786 --> 35:57,336
And I say, hello there, in what direction is gravity?"

477
35:57,586 --> 36:00,956
And you say, gravity is in this direction."

478
36:01,346 --> 36:04,876
Why? Because you feel the string is pulling on you
in this direction."

479
36:05,396 --> 36:07,356
So you experience gravity there."

480
36:09,226 --> 36:12,346
Now comes the question, how real is this?"

481
36:13,166 --> 36:16,486
This is very, very real."

482
36:17,746 --> 36:18,956
It is so real"

483
36:19,846 --> 36:29,566
that if I took a bucket of water
instead of you,
and here is the bucket of water,"

484
36:33,086 --> 36:38,156
I attached to the bucket a rope,"

485
36:38,526 --> 36:46,616
I swing it around and I swing it around such
that the centripetal acceleration is substantially larger than 9.8."

486
36:47,486 --> 36:51,136
So the string is definitely going to pull."

487
36:53,756 --> 37:00,806
So, if you were the water, and I ask you where is gravity,
you would say the gravitational direction is in this direction."

488
37:01,326 --> 37:06,356
And so the water will say, okay, fine.
Then this will be my surface, and I want to go in this direction."

489
37:07,186 --> 37:10,976
But the water can't go in that direction, so it will just stay there."

490
37:12,116 --> 37:28,006
So I could swing this thing around
if I do it fast enough, so fast
that the acceleration at this point here
must be larger than 9.8, the water will stay up
while the bucket is upside down."

491
37:29,806 --> 37:32,316
How fast fast should I rotate it?"

492
37:33,266 --> 37:41,696
Well, let's put in some simple numbers.
I have here this bucket
and let's say that this is about 1 meter."

493
37:42,266 --> 37:43,766
just round some numbers off."

494
37:44,386 --> 37:47,716
So R is about 1 meter."

495
37:48,516 --> 37:57,956
And I want V square over R,
I want that to be larger than 9.8."

496
37:58,126 --> 37:58,686
Let's just call it 10."

497
37:59,436 --> 38:04,426
So that means V has to be larger than about 3.2 meters per second."

498
38:05,936 --> 38:13,096
The time to go around is 2 pi r
divided by this velocity."

499
38:13,586 --> 38:18,706
So this time to go around then has to be less than
has to be less than two seconds."

500
38:20,086 --> 38:23,266
So if I swing this around in less than two seconds,"

501
38:23,266 --> 38:23,866
I would be okay."

502
38:23,866 --> 38:33,276
Now, I realize that the speed when I
move this thing around is not constant everywhere.
That's very difficult to do that because of gravity."

503
38:33,506 --> 38:35,296
But it's close enough to get an idea."

504
38:35,846 --> 38:47,726
So if I rotate this faster than in two seconds,
when the bucket is upside down,
if physics works, the water should not fall out."

505
38:49,566 --> 38:52,676
So, let us fill this with water."

506
38:56,266 --> 38:58,286
There we go."

507
39:01,856 --> 39:02,726
There we go."

508
39:07,256 --> 39:07,596
Okay."

509
39:09,666 --> 39:12,286
I'm always nervous about this."

510
39:13,246 --> 39:14,846
Um let's first look at the centrifuge."

511
39:15,966 --> 39:19,446
We have to see whether the centrifuge has done its job."

512
39:25,466 --> 39:30,696
So let's look at what this tube,
I think it was tube number four."

513
39:31,726 --> 39:32,716
Oh yeah."

514
39:33,296 --> 39:37,976
Very clear is now the liquid
and you see the white stuff here on the side."

515
39:38,246 --> 39:42,026
It's not so easy for you to see really."

516
39:42,346 --> 39:42,936
Put my hand under here."

517
39:43,256 --> 39:46,016
Maybe some of you can see some white stuff, but it's no longer milk."

518
39:46,606 --> 39:50,296
It's really a clear liquid, and you see some white stuff here."

519
39:51,016 --> 39:52,776
But it's also on the side."

520
39:53,036 --> 39:54,736
You can actually see it here."

521
39:56,776 --> 40:02,856
You see the white stuff because this was the direction of gravity,
so it ended up here and there's some here."

522
40:03,216 --> 40:04,686
But it's completely clear."

523
40:05,316 --> 40:06,466
You see the white stuff?"

524
40:07,966 --> 40:14,236
So that's the way that you can separate the silver chloride."

525
40:15,696 --> 40:21,556
So now we come to this daredevil daredevil experiment."

526
40:22,836 --> 40:32,876
And we're going to see whether we can fool the water
and make the water think that gravity is not in this direction, but in this direction."

527
40:33,646 --> 40:35,346
Now you're doing the right thing there."

528
40:36,546 --> 40:38,436
I don't blame you at all."

529
40:40,826 --> 40:41,506
Okay."

530
40:44,796 --> 40:45,856
There we go."

531
40:47,156 --> 40:49,246
You see the water is completely fooled."

532
40:49,566 --> 40:53,166
And notice that I go around substantially faster than in two seconds."

533
40:53,886 --> 40:57,686
And the water when it's up there, just thinks that gravity is towards the ceiling."

534
40:58,826 --> 40:59,596
Physics works."

535
50:00,266 --> 50:04,186
Now, who is going to do this for me too?
Please, someone should try this."

536
50:06,266 --> 50:07,666
You think you can do it?"

537
50:08,906 --> 50:10,506
Come on, try it."

538
50:11,206 --> 50:13,616
In the worst case, it will be a disaster."

539
50:16,616 --> 50:21,466
Okay, get some feel for it, but before you do it,
make sure that I'm out of the way."

540
50:22,636 --> 50:24,346
So first, swing it a little."

541
50:24,976 --> 50:27,896
And don't hold it too close to you because I don't want you to get hurt."

542
50:28,626 --> 50:30,666
Larger swing, larger."

543
50:31,146 --> 50:32,316
And then you get some feel for it."

544
50:32,686 --> 50:33,706
Go for it now."

545
50:35,836 --> 50:36,826
Yeah, faster."

546
50:40,206 --> 50:41,286
That was very good."

547
50:42,386 --> 50:43,566
See you Friday."
