1
00:00:01,363 --> 00:00:05,463
We're going to discuss today resistive forces and drag forces.

2
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:13,863
When you move an object through a medium, whether it's a gas or whether it's a liquid, it experiences a drag force.

3
00:01:40,00 --> 00:01:40,000


4
00:00:14,143 --> 00:00:22,913
This drag force depends on the shape of the object, the size of the object, the medium through which you move it, and the speed of the object.

5
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:25,313
The medium is immediately obvious.

6
00:00:25,813 --> 00:00:30,733
If it's air and you move through air, you feel the wind through your hair. That's a drag force.

7
00:00:31,363 --> 00:00:33,743
If you swim in water, you feel this drag force.

8
00:00:34,373 --> 00:00:37,443
In oil, the drag force would be even larger.

9
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:49,003
This drag force, this resistive force is very, very different from the friction that we've discussed earlier when two surfaces move relative to each other.

10
00:00:49,393 --> 00:00:55,753
There, the kinetic friction coefficient remains constant independent of the speed.

11
00:00:56,193 --> 00:01:02,713
With the drag forces and the resistive forces, they are not at all independent of the speed.

12
00:01:03,473 --> 00:01:21,833
In very general terms, the resistive force can be written as K1 times the velocity plus K2 times the velocity squared.

13
00:01:22,693 --> 00:01:26,373
And always in the opposite direction of the velocity vector.

14
00:01:26,663 --> 00:01:36,133
This V here is a speed. So all these signs, K1, V and K2, and obviously V squared, they all are positive values.

15
00:01:36,373 --> 00:01:43,213
And the K values depend on the shape and the size of the object and on the kind of medium that I have.

16
00:01:43,893 --> 00:01:48,353
Today I will restrict myself exclusively to spheres.

17
00:01:48,733 --> 00:02:11,613
And when we deal with spheres, we're going to get that the the force, the magnitude of the force, so that it's this part equals C1 times R times the speed plus c2 times R squared times V squared.

18
00:02:12,563 --> 00:02:16,523
And again, it's always opposing the velocity vector.

19
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:24,133
C1 in our units is kilograms per meter per second.

20
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:29,803
And C2 has the dimension of density, kilogram per cubic meters.

21
00:02:31,643 --> 00:02:39,113
We call this the viscous term and we call this the pressure term.

22
00:02:40,003 --> 00:02:45,253
The viscous term has to do with the stickiness of the medium.

23
00:02:46,203 --> 00:02:56,273
If you take for instance liquids, water, and oil and tar, there is a huge difference in stickiness. Physicists also refer to that as viscosity.

24
00:02:56,693 --> 00:03:03,503
If you have a high viscosity, it's very sticky, then this number C1 will be very high.

25
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:06,513
So this we call the viscous term.

26
00:03:07,443 --> 00:03:12,263
And this we call the pressure term.

27
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:17,493
The C1 is a strong function of temperature.

28
00:03:17,773 --> 00:03:25,693
We all know that if you take tar and you heat it, that the viscosity goes down. It is way more sticky when it is cold.

29
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:30,533
C2 is not very dependent on the temperature.

30
00:03:31,823 --> 00:03:37,303
It's not so easy to see why this pressure term here has a V square.

31
00:03:37,303 --> 00:03:43,573
Later in the course when we deal with transfer of momentum, we will understand why there is a V square term there.

32
00:03:44,023 --> 00:04:08,603
But the R square is very easy to see because if you have a sphere and there is some fluid, gas or liquid streaming onto it, then this has a cross-sectional area which is proportional to R squared. And so it's easy to see that the force that this object experience, we call it the pressure term, is proportional to R squared. So that's easy to see.

33
00:04:08,603 --> 00:04:23,153
Two liquids with the very same density would have, they could have very different values for C1. They could differ by 10 orders, not 10, by four or five orders of magnitude.

34
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:29,133
But if they have the same density, the liquids, then the C2 is very much the same.

35
00:04:29,323 --> 00:04:39,593
C2 is almost the density row of the liquid, not quite, but almost. But there is a very strong correlation between the C2 and the density.

36
00:04:40,783 --> 00:04:47,683
If I drop an object and I just let it go, I take an object and I let it fall.

37
00:04:47,683 --> 00:04:50,083
We're only dealing with spheres today.

38
00:04:50,453 --> 00:04:53,093
Then what you will see, I have a mass M.

39
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:58,123
And so there is a force mg, that is gravity.

40
00:04:58,643 --> 00:05:08,113
And as it picks up speed, the resistive force will grow, and it will grow, and it will grow.

41
00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:15,023
And there comes a time, because the speed increases, so the resistive force will grow, and there comes a time that the two are equal.

42
00:05:15,573 --> 00:05:21,433
And when the two are equal, then there is no longer acceleration, so the object has a constant speed.

43
00:05:21,783 --> 00:05:24,603
And we call that the terminal velocity.

44
00:05:25,173 --> 00:05:39,213
And that will be the case when mg equals C1 RV plus C2 R squared V squared.

45
00:05:39,563 --> 00:05:46,423
And then we have here terminal velocity.

46
00:05:49,243 --> 00:06:08,043
If you know what M is, the mass of an object, the radius, and you know the values for C1 or C2 of that medium in which you move it, then you can calculate what the terminal velocity is. It is a quadratic equation, so you get two solutions, of which one of them is non-physical.

47
00:06:08,363 --> 00:06:10,223
So you can reject that one.

48
00:06:11,643 --> 00:06:22,453
Very often will we work in a domain, in a regime whereby this viscous term is dominating.

49
00:06:22,743 --> 00:06:32,723
I call that regime one, but it also happens, and I will show you examples today, that we're working in a regime where really this force is dominating.

50
00:06:32,873 --> 00:06:35,593
I call that regime two.

51
00:06:38,073 --> 00:06:46,503
Where one and two are the same, where the force due to the viscous force and the pressure force are the same,

52
00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:58,353
we can make these terms the same. So you get C1 RV equals C2 R square V squared, and that velocity we call the critical velocity,

53
00:06:58,503 --> 00:07:07,933
even though there is nothing critical about it. It's not critical at all. It's simply the speed at which the two terms are equal. That's all it means.

54
00:07:08,383 --> 00:07:13,233
And that is of course then equal C1 divided by C2 divided by R.

55
00:07:14,753 --> 00:07:21,203
Now we're going to make a clear distinction between the domains one and two, the regimes one and two.

56
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:30,653
Regime one is when the speed is much, much less than the critical velocity.

57
00:07:31,313 --> 00:07:40,083
So we then have that mg equals C1 RV terminal.

58
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:49,043
And therefore, the terminal velocity equals mg divided by C1R.

59
00:07:49,813 --> 00:08:08,723
If you take objects of the same material, that means they have the same density, the density of the objects that you drop in the liquid or that you drop in the gas, so that M equals 4/3 pi rho R cubed.

60
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:21,363
This is now the rho, the density of the object, it's not the density of the medium, then you can immediately see since you get an r cube here, that this is proportional to the square of the radius.

61
00:08:21,363 --> 00:08:27,083
If you drop objects in there with the same density.

62
00:08:27,793 --> 00:08:33,223
Regime two is the case when V is much larger than V critical.

63
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:40,423
So then mg equals c2 r squared V squared.

64
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:51,293
If this is the terminal velocity, So the terminal velocity is then the square root of mg divided by C2 R squared.

65
00:08:51,793 --> 00:08:55,503
mg divided by C2 R squared.

66
00:08:55,763 --> 00:09:06,223
And if you take objects with the same density and you compare their radii, M is proportional to r cubed, so this is now proportional to the square root of R.

67
00:09:07,643 --> 00:09:19,793
So this separates these two regimes, and we will see examples of that that sometimes you really work exclusively in one, and sometimes you work in the other.

68
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:30,133
I have for you a view graph that is on the on the web, so you do not have to copy it.

69
00:09:30,463 --> 00:09:33,183
It summarizes what I have just told you.

70
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,253
It has all the key equations.

71
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:40,193
You see there on top the resistive force, the magnitude of the resistive force.

72
00:09:40,683 --> 00:09:50,743
You see then the critical velocity. There's nothing critical about it. It's just the speed at which this term has the same magnitude as this term.

73
00:09:51,163 --> 01:00:00,053
Then you see the condition here, which I called equation one for terminal speed. And then

74
01:00:00,053 --> 01:01:56,413
we have regime one whereby the speed is way less than the critical speed, and then you get the terminal velocity, as you see on the blackboard, which then is proportional to r squared, if you only look at objects which have a particular given density. And if the velocity, if the speed is way larger than the critical speed, you are in regime two, and then you have a dependence with the square root of R.

75
01:02:88,143 --> 01:04:42,993
I'm going to do a demonstration and some measurements with ball bearings, which have very precise radii, very well known, which I'm going to drop into syrup.

76
01:04:48,993 --> 01:04:95,353
And we have chosen for that Caro light corn syrup.

77
01:05:07,3 --> 01:05:64,13
It may interest you that two tablespoons is 180 calories.

78
01:05:72,13 --> 01:10:31,93
I needed to know more for this demonstration, and so I had to do my own homework on it.

79
01:10:43,193 --> 01:10:91,53
But at least you see here what this Caro syrup can do for you.

80
01:10:95,73 --> 01:11:38,43
You see 180 calories per two tablespoons or per tablespoon.

81
01:11:42,43 --> 01:11:87,43
It's very low fat and the rest may interest you before you use it.

82
01:11:84,43 --> 01:13:01,83
I had to know C1, which I calculated, I measured it. In fact, what the kind of demonstration we and I will be doing today, you can derive it, but it's very strongly temperature dependent.

83
01:13:11,83 --> 01:13:31,33
could be different yesterday from today.

84
01:13:37,83 --> 01:13:69,33
Um, I measured C2 to a reasonable accuracy.

85
01:13:74,33 --> 01:14:59,43
Notice that the density of the syrup in terms of kilograms per cubic meter is very close to C2. I mentioned that earlier.

86
01:14:65,43 --> 01:14:91,93
They're very close, not exactly, but very close.

87
01:14:96,33 --> 01:15:58,83
These steel ball bearings have a density of about 7,800 kilograms per cubic meter.

88
01:15:61,83 --> 01:20:89,33
And I'm going to drop in that caro syrup four ball bearings, and they have diameters of an 8th of an inch, 5/32nds, 3/16ths, and a quarter of an inch.

89
01:21:06,33 --> 01:21:91,93
And what I calculated was the terminal velocity as a function of radius of these ball bearings.

90
01:22:02,13 --> 01:22:19,63
All of this is on the web.

91
01:22:39,43 --> 01:23:28,83
And so what you see here, it is a logarithmic plot. This is the log scale and this is a log scale. Here you see the speed, and here you see the radius in meters of the ball bearings.

92
01:23:39,93 --> 01:24:43,33
And this is my solution to equation number one, when I substitute various values of R in there, I get the terminal speed like this.

93
01:24:55,13 --> 01:25:04,73
And this is the critical speed, which is has a one over R relationship.

94
01:25:06,13 --> 01:25:91,53
If you look at this black dot here, then the terminal speed is 10 times larger here than the critical speed.

95
01:25:93,93 --> 01:31:20,83
And so notice that when you are at speeds above that, that you are exclusively in domain two, and your terminal speed is proportional to the square root of the radius of the ball bearings.

96
01:31:20,83 --> 01:31:59,93
This black dot is a factor of 10 below the critical speed.

97
01:31:61,93 --> 01:32:72,83
And so you see when you are at lower speeds, when you work here, again, you see that you fall into exclusively in domain one, and you see that the terminal speed is proportional to r squared.

98
01:32:76,83 --> 01:33:42,43
This slope here is plus two in this diagram and this slope here is plus one half.

99
01:33:48,33 --> 01:34:29,13
Our ball bearings are all here. And so we are exclusively operating in regime one where the viscous term dominates.

100
01:34:36,13 --> 01:35:11,93
Now you could say, well, what is the meaning of this critical speed here? If they never reach that speed anyhow.

101
01:35:14,33 --> 01:41:71,63
Well, this critical speed for a small ball bearing would be some 100 m per second, that's about 200 miles per hour. There is nothing wrong with injecting a ball bearing with 400 miles per hour into this syrup. In which case, if you injected it with 400 miles per hour, you would be above the critical speed. And so for a short while would the motion be controlled by the pressure term.

102
01:41:71,63 --> 01:42:14,13
But of course, when gravity takes over, then you ultimately end up in regime one.

103
01:42:24,73 --> 01:43:21,83
But that's the meaning of the critical velocity. If you could give the ball bearing such a high speed, then the two terms are equal. That's all it means.

104
01:43:37,33 --> 01:44:37,53
Very well. Now we are going to look at the various ball bearings, the various sizes. And I'll show you how we do the experiment.

105
01:44:48,23 --> 01:45:34,23
You will shortly see a on the screen there seven marks which are 1 cm apart.

106
01:45:41,73 --> 01:45:81,23
They are in the liquid, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So here is the liquid.

107
01:45:92,73 --> 01:50:23,13
And the ball bearings are dropped from above. When it reaches this line, I will start my timer.

108
01:50:73,73 --> 01:51:24,13
And when it crosses 1, 2, 3, 4, when it crosses this line, I will stop my timer.

109
01:51:35,13 --> 01:51:95,83
And each mark is about 1 centimeter apart. So this is a journey of about 4 centimeters.

110
01:52:10,43 --> 01:52:53,93
And we will measure the time that it takes to go from here to here.

111
01:52:57,43 --> 01:53:35,53
And the terminal velocity is given, it's clearly regime one, so you see the terminal velocity right there.

112
01:53:49,33 --> 01:54:75,53
Now the time that it will take is of course this distance, let me call it H, that the ball bearings travel divided by the terminal velocity.

113
01:54:80,43 --> 01:55:34,83
And that is proportional since you're in regime one by 1 over R squared.

114
01:55:43,33 --> 01:50:22,33
And now I will give you the not the radii, but I will give you the diameters of these ball bearings. That's the way they come.

115
01:50:26,63 --> 01:51:03,53
So we're going to get a list here of the diameters of the ball bearings and their diameters is in inches.

116
01:51:08,53 --> 01:51:33,73
My smallest one has a diameter of an 8th of an inch.

117
01:51:38,13 --> 01:51:92,43
Then I have 530 seconds. I have 3/16ths.

118
01:51:95,63 --> 01:52:50,93
All these things come in inches. That's one of those things. And I have 1 quarter inch diameter.

119
01:52:73,13 --> 01:53:96,63
If I plot here or plot, if I give you here the diameter in terms of 130 seconds of an inch, then this is 4, 5, 6, and 8. Easy numbers.

120
01:54:12,63 --> 01:55:05,33
Clearly, if the time that it takes is proportional to 1/ r squared, it will also be proportional to 1/ d squared. Of course, that's the same.

121
01:55:14,43 --> 02:00:70,83
What I am going to plot is not 1 over d squared, but to get some nice numbers, I'm going to plot for you 100 over d squared, whereby d is then in these units 130 seconds of an inch.

122
02:00:76,33 --> 02:02:45,13
And that gives me some nice numbers. Then I get a 6.25 here. I get a 4.00 here. You can see 100 divided by 25 is exactly 4. I get 2.78 here and my last number is 1.56.

123
02:02:48,43 --> 02:02:68,93
And now I'm going to time it.

124
02:02:72,23 --> 02:03:29,13
And my timing uncertainty is of course dictated by my reaction time.

125
02:03:32,33 --> 02:03:62,73
That should be at least 0.1 second.

126
02:03:66,23 --> 02:04:61,83
However, you will see when I reach the quarter inch ball bearing, that it goes so fast that my error could well be 2/10 of a second. It goes in a flash.

127
02:04:65,53 --> 02:05:52,53
So I would allow here two/10 of a second, and here I really don't know, maybe 1/10, maybe two/10 of a second.

128
02:05:56,23 --> 02:10:33,33
You may ask me, why didn't you give us the error in the diameter, which ultimately, of course, translates into the error in the mass.

129
02:10:33,33 --> 02:11:43,33
The reason is that these are so precise the way you buy them, that the uncertainty is completely negligible compared to the timing error that I make. So I won't even take that into account.

130
02:11:64,53 --> 02:12:14,83
All right, so now we can start the demonstration.

131
02:12:14,83 --> 02:12:70,83
And I'll have to switch to this unit here.

132
02:12:77,33 --> 02:13:44,43
Here is this container with the caro syrup.

133
02:13:44,43 --> 02:13:78,93
It is very sticky indeed.

134
02:14:12,93 --> 02:15:85,83
You see there are seven marks and just for my own convenience, I have put there two black marks so that I can easily see the moment that I have to start my timer and the moment that I stop it. There are so many lines, I may get confused if I don't do that.

135
02:15:91,53 --> 02:10:21,33
And we are going to time this together.

136
02:10:32,33 --> 02:10:92,43
And we'll see how these objects how long it takes for them to go through.

137
02:10:92,43 --> 02:11:25,43
I will start with my 18 of an inch diameter.

138
02:11:40,13 --> 02:11:70,13
I have one here, tweezer.

139
02:11:94,13 --> 02:12:10,43
I release it at zero.

140
02:12:15,53 --> 02:12:40,33
Three, oh, oh, you can't see that. You should see that.

141
02:12:46,83 --> 02:12:69,93
3, 2, 1, zero.

142
02:12:77,43 --> 02:13:43,63
Look how beautiful. It's working its way through. You see it's building up. See that see that nice air bubble at the top.

143
02:13:53,13 --> 02:14:02,43
It's going very slowly, but just wait when it has broken through the surface. There it goes.

144
02:14:06,63 --> 02:14:22,13
Now.

145
02:14:32,73 --> 02:14:80,63
1 centimeter, 2 centimeter, 3 centimeter. Now.

146
02:14:84,93 --> 02:15:01,33
Okay, what is that?

147
02:15:06,93 --> 02:15:13,93
Nothing.

148
02:15:17,83 --> 02:15:30,13
What happened?

149
02:15:35,63 --> 02:15:52,13
5.93

150
02:15:58,43 --> 02:15:79,33
I didn't see it. I want to do another one.

151
02:15:94,63 --> 02:20:33,33
What? Did I did I clean did I erase it?

152
02:20:39,73 --> 02:20:48,93
How much was it?

153
02:20:57,23 --> 02:20:80,73
5.93

154
02:21:09,3 --> 02:21:43,23
Keep that in mind. It's nice to see whether they reproduce, actually.

155
02:21:67,13 --> 02:21:82,73
Okay, there it goes.

156
02:21:93,13 --> 02:22:00,73
Now,

157
02:22:06,33 --> 02:22:55,53
1 centimeter, 2 centimeter, 3 centimeter. Now.

158
02:22:61,63 --> 02:22:98,83
5.66. You that shows you the uncertainty in my timing.

159
02:23:01,73 --> 02:23:57,73
So we had a 5.93 and we have now a 5.66.

160
02:23:61,73 --> 02:24:12,13
It's not so bad. 5.9, 5.7, timing error 10 of a second.

161
02:24:15,83 --> 02:24:53,63
My timing error could be a little bit larger than the 10 of a second. You don't have very much time.

162
02:24:58,13 --> 02:25:03,73
So now we go to the 5:30 seconds.

163
02:25:31,13 --> 02:25:39,73
Okay.

164
02:25:46,73 --> 02:25:61,83
5:30 seconds.

165
02:30:07,13 --> 02:30:84,53
takes some time to break through the surface, isn't that funny? Because a thin film has formed on the surface of the syrup due to its exposure to air.

166
02:30:89,23 --> 02:31:25,73
Wonderful, huh? Let's us wait patiently, but now it goes.

167
02:31:28,93 --> 02:31:84,53
There it goes. Now, one, two, three. Now.

168
02:31:93,43 --> 02:32:11,53
3.80.

169
02:32:16,33 --> 02:32:33,43
Is that what you have?

170
02:32:62,83 --> 02:32:89,53
You're going to be tougher and tougher for me.

171
02:32:96,13 --> 02:33:18,73
3/16 of an inch.

172
02:33:33,3 --> 02:33:82,93
It's actually a good thing that it stays for a while at the surface so that I can get ready.

173
02:34:24,13 --> 02:34:43,83
Really that really helps, doesn't it?

174
02:34:58,23 --> 02:34:91,33
If you do this in water, it goes You don't even see it.

175
02:35:14,93 --> 02:35:35,13
Come on. Here we go. Now.

176
02:35:47,93 --> 02:35:64,73
No.

177
02:35:68,43 --> 02:40:11,53
So you see that's very hard for me and so I could easily have a substantial error. 2.69.

178
02:40:47,23 --> 02:41:00,13
And now we have the quarter inch the real big one.

179
02:41:45,23 --> 02:41:64,23
I have to do that again.

180
02:41:68,23 --> 02:42:08,63
I don't trust this at all. It went it went through the surface too fast.

181
02:43:05,13 --> 02:43:14,13
I can't do it very accurately. What was the first number by the way?

182
02:43:36,53 --> 02:43:61,83
1 point 68.

183
02:43:66,53 --> 02:43:80,13
And this is 1.40.

184
02:43:84,83 --> 02:44:10,83
So 1.68 and 1.40.

185
02:44:10,83 --> 02:44:74,73
So you see I wasn't kidding when I said that my uncertainty could easily be 0.2. Now comes the acid test.

186
02:44:98,3 --> 02:45:54,43
And the acid test is that if I'm if the measurements were done correctly and if we really work in that regime, then if I plot 100 divided by D squared versus T on linear paper, then it should be a straight line.

187
02:46:21,23 --> 02:46:90,63
Here I have a plot which I prepared and I'm going to put these numbers in there.

188
02:46:98,13 --> 02:48:17,13
So first, we're going to get 6.5 5. let's put in 5.8 seconds for the smallest ball bearing.

189
02:48:17,13 --> 02:49:32,23
This is the smallest one. Don't be misled because this is 100 divided by d squared. So this is the smallest one.

190
02:49:38,63 --> 02:49:99,63
5.8.

191
02:50:21,73 --> 02:50:84,13
So we are here on this line and we are at 5.8 somewhere here.

192
02:50:84,13 --> 02:51:19,13
That's it.

193
02:51:44,63 --> 02:51:69,63
Notice, the point is lower than where I expected it.

194
02:51:75,13 --> 02:52:33,13
And the reason is the temperature went up. And if the temperature went up, then the viscosity goes down and they go faster.

195
02:52:36,63 --> 02:52:49,63
But that's okay. That doesn't worry me.

196
02:52:54,13 --> 02:52:78,13
The next one, 3.80.

197
02:53:05,93 --> 02:53:28,33
4 3.80.

198
02:53:39,23 --> 02:53:54,13
Ah! You see that?

199
02:53:63,63 --> 02:53:82,43
I predicted that straight line.

200
02:53:96,33 --> 02:54:20,93
Isn't that a straight line?

201
02:54:47,83 --> 02:54:69,13
It's not a straight line?

202
02:54:78,33 --> 02:54:89,13
What's wrong?

203
02:55:18,63 --> 02:55:35,43
Okay, we'll put in the third point.

204
02:55:40,73 --> 02:55:65,93
2.69

205
02:55:84,23 --> 02:56:46,43
2. This is 2.7, 2.69.

206
02:56:51,53 --> 02:57:26,73
I can't hardly put in the error of the timing because it is not much larger than the size of my dot.

207
02:57:32,23 --> 02:57:98,73
And now we have the last one, 1 point, let's take the average, 1.55.

208
02:58:07,63 --> 02:58:29,33
1.55.

209
02:58:38,13 --> 02:59:31,73
With an error of about two tenth of a second, and this has an error of about two tenth of a second.

210
02:59:41,33 --> 03:00:13,33
All right, there we go.

211
03:00:18,63 --> 03:00:48,43
Now, is this a straight line or is it not?

212
03:00:68,63 --> 03:00:94,53
Gorgeous straight line.

213
03:00:94,53 --> 03:01:60,83
And so you see you are really working here in the regime where the terminal velocity is proportional to the radius squared.

214
03:01:67,43 --> 03:01:92,73
Okay, we'll give you your lights back.

215
03:02:18,43 --> 03:03:37,23
Now comes a question which is relevant to this experiment, and that is, how long does it take for the terminal speed to be reached?

216
03:03:64,63 --> 03:04:26,93
Well, the object has a certain mass, so there is a gravitational force on it.

217
03:04:60,63 --> 03:05:18,23
And the gravitational force equals mg. And then there is a resistive force

218
03:05:24,73 --> 03:06:89,53
which in the case because we are operating in regime one exclusively, that resistive force equals C1 RV in terms of magnitude because we deal with regime one.

219
03:06:96,23 --> 03:07:85,83
And so, if I call this the increasing value of Y, the second Newton's second law would give me MA equals mg - C1R times V.

220
03:07:85,83 --> 03:08:48,93
And this equals MdVDT. So I have here a differential equation in V.

221
03:08:94,93 --> 03:09:71,23
And that can be solved. And you are going to solve it on your assignment number four.

222
03:09:95,93 --> 03:11:17,63
What you're going to see is that the speed as a function of time is going to build up to a maximum value. This is the to a maximum value which is the terminal velocity, or you may want to call it terminal speed. and it's going to build up in some fashion,

223
03:11:17,63 --> 03:11:42,33
and then it going asymptotically approach the terminal speed.

224
03:11:51,83 --> 03:12:10,83
And this is what I'm asking you on your third on your fourth assignment to calculate that.

225
03:12:13,33 --> 03:12:64,53
If there were no drag force at all, I hope you realize that the velocity would increase linearly.

226
03:12:70,3 --> 03:13:15,3
So you would get something like this. So there's no drag.

227
03:13:51,23 --> 03:13:99,53
So the behavior is extremely different due to the drag.

228
03:14:08,73 --> 03:15:33,23
And I calculated already something that is part of your assignment, how long does it take for the quarter inch ball bearing,

229
03:15:33,23 --> 03:16:26,63
how long does it take in time to reach a speed which is about 99% of the terminal speed.

230
03:16:26,63 --> 03:17:36,73
And I calculated that, and you will go through the calculation for yourself, that is only 9 milliseconds.

231
03:17:45,3 --> 03:18:86,3
In other words, once it has broken through the surface, that takes a while because of the thin film, then in 9 milliseconds will I already be at 99% of the terminal speed.

232
03:18:86,3 --> 03:19:82,3
And so there was no problem at all when I waited for the object to cross the first mark,

233
03:19:82,3 --> 03:20:18,43
it was already clearly going at the terminal speed.

234
03:20:18,43 --> 03:20:42,53
So that was fine.

235
03:20:59,3 --> 03:21:25,73
Now I want to turn to air.

236
03:21:47,93 --> 03:22:83,33
Air, of course, behaves in an extremely different way. The principle is the same, but the values for C1 and C2 are vastly difference.

237
03:22:83,33 --> 03:24:56,43
If we take air at one atmosphere and we take it at room temperature,

238
03:24:63,3 --> 03:25:29,83
then C1 is about 3.1 * 10 to the -4 in our units and C2 is about 0.85.

239
03:25:75,83 --> 03:27:54,93
This is very close to the density of air, which is about 1 kg per cubic meter, which I told you earlier, C2 and row are very strongly related.

240
03:27:96,93 --> 03:29:17,33
And so the critical speed which is c1 divided by c2 by r

241
03:29:17,33 --> 03:30:16,53
is about 3.7 times 10 to the minus 4 divided by r meters per second.

242
03:30:46,83 --> 03:31:43,93
And that is about 400 times lower than the critical speed in syrup, in the caro syrup for the same value of R.

243
03:31:81,43 --> 03:33:82,83
So if I compare the quarter inch ball bearing and I drop it in the caro syrup, then the terminal velocity in the caro syrup is way below the critical velocity of the caro syrup.

244
03:33:82,83 --> 03:34:92,93
The critical velocity of the caro syrup would be 100 miles per hour for a quarter inch ball bearing. So it's way below.

245
03:35:02,43 --> 03:37:36,93
Here in air, the critical velocity is something like 11 cm per second. This is 11 cm in 1 second.

246
03:37:36,93 --> 03:39:55,73
And we know when you drop a 1 quarter inch ball bearing in air that the speed is way larger. And therefore,

247
03:39:55,73 --> 03:41:43,33
in the case of air, a quarter inch ball bearing would have a speed way above the critical speed,

248
03:41:43,33 --> 03:42:26,93
and so you are now exclusively in regime two. That's the regime two.

249
03:42:48,63 --> 03:43:61,33
Almost all spheres that you drop in air

250
03:43:61,3 --> 03:44:48,3
operate exclusively in regime two.

251
03:44:86,43 --> 03:45:54,3
Whether it is a raindrop

252
03:45:71,93 --> 03:46:36,93
or whether it is a baseball that you hit or a golf ball.

253
03:46:88,93 --> 03:47:66,83
or even a beach ball,

254
03:47:89,93 --> 03:49:17,23
or you throw a pebble of a high building,

255
03:49:40,43 --> 03:50:81,33
or whether you jump out of an airplane with or without a parachute, makes no difference. You're always dominated by the pressure term, by the V squared term.

256
03:50:81,3 --> 03:52:76,33
and you always are in a range whereby the terminal speed is proportional to the square root of radius

257
03:52:76,33 --> 03:53:28,63
for a given density of the object.

258
03:53:68,3 --> 03:55:38,43
If you take a pebble with a radius of about 1 cm and you throw it off a high building,

259
03:55:38,43 --> 03:57:17,43
it will reach a speed which will not exceed 75 miles per hour

260
03:57:17,43 --> 03:57:65,33
because of the air drag.

261
03:57:90,93 --> 04:00:62,43
If you jump out of a plane and you have no parachute,

262
04:00:62,43 --> 04:02:12,53
and I make the assumption that your mass

263
04:02:12,53 --> 04:03:38,83
is about 70 kg.

264
04:03:80,13 --> 04:05:09,33
I want rough numbers. If I can approximate you by a sphere

265
04:05:09,3 --> 04:07:18,73
with a radius of about 40 cm, that's also an approximation.

266
04:07:18,73 --> 04:09:80,53
You're not really like a sphere, but I want to get some some rough numbers.

267
04:09:80,53 --> 04:11:38,3
Then the terminal velocity

268
04:11,38,3 --> 04:12,99,93
is 150 miles per hour.

269
04:13,14,13 --> 04:14,85,83
So if you jump out of a plane and you have no parachute,

270
04:14,85,83 --> 04:16,58,53
you will not go much faster than 150 miles per hour.

271
04:16,15,23 --> 04:18,48,73
I just read an article yesterday about skydivers

272
04:18,48,73 --> 04:21,95,93
who jump out of planes and they want to open the parachute at the very last possible,

273
04:21,95,93 --> 04:25,91,33
and they reach terminal velocities of 120 miles per hour,

274
04:25,91,33 --> 04:28,50,53
which doesn't surprise me. It's very close to this rough number that I calculated.

275
04:28,50,53 --> 04:30,99,23
Of course, then they open the parachute and then the air drag

276
04:31,17,3 --> 04:33,31,33
increases enormously, and then they slow down

277
04:33,31,33 --> 04:33,70,53
even further.

278
04:33,79,33 --> 04:35,39,33
I told you a raindrop,

279
04:35,39,33 --> 04:38,91,83
almost all raindrops operate in regime two when they fall. So the terminal velocity is dictated by the V square term.

280
04:39,32,43 --> 04:43,11,93
However, if you make the drops exceedingly small, there comes a time that you really enter regime one.

281
04:43,47,3 --> 04:45,67,83
And on assignment number four, I've asked you to calculate

282
04:45,67,83 --> 04:47,27,33
where that happens.

283
04:47,27,33 --> 04:50,11,33
And I can't do it for water because the radius of that water drop will be so small

284
04:50,11,33 --> 04:52,90,53
that it would evaporate immediately.

285
04:52,90,53 --> 04:54,13,73
So I chose oil for that.

286
04:54,48,3 --> 04:59,88,13
So I'm asking you in assignment four, take an oil drop, make it smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller,

287
04:59,88,13 --> 05:01,89,83
and there comes a time that you begin to enter

288
05:01,89,83 --> 05:02,91,13
regime one.

289
05:03,23,53 --> 05:06,81,13
And I want you to calculate where that crossover is

290
05:06,81,13 --> 05:08,89,33
between these two domains.

291
05:09,20,3 --> 05:12,34,13
I have here

292
05:12,34,13 --> 05:13,23,83
a a ball.

293
05:13,23,83 --> 05:16,71,53
You may call it a balloon, but I call it a ball because there's no helium in it.

294
05:16,84,93 --> 05:18,83,93
And this

295
05:19,11,73 --> 05:21,68,53
ball

296
05:21,68,53 --> 05:23,23,63
weighs

297
05:23,23,63 --> 05:25,90,73
approximately 34 grams.

298
05:26,22,23 --> 05:28,82,23
So, let me

299
05:28,82,23 --> 05:30,89,33
erase some here

300
05:30,89,33 --> 05:32,65,33
because I want

301
05:32,65,33 --> 05:33,35,33
Yeah.

302
05:33,89,83 --> 05:35,19,33
So we know the mass.

303
05:35,52,43 --> 05:36,28,33
And we know the radius.

304
05:36,51,13 --> 05:38,42,93
The mass is about 34 grams.

305
05:38,42,93 --> 05:41,23,43
And the radius is about 35 cm.

306
05:41,23,43 --> 05:42,79,33
It's about 70 cm across.

307
05:43,44,3 --> 05:45,24,33
I can calculate what the terminal

308
05:45,24,33 --> 05:48,96,33
velocity is, better name would be terminal speed.

309
05:48,96,33 --> 05:50,55,73
I know I'm definitely going to be in this regime.

310
05:50,55,73 --> 05:53,45,73
So I know the mass, I know C2 which in air is 0.85,

311
05:53,45,73 --> 05:55,43,33
I know the radius and I know G.

312
05:55,43,33 --> 05:58,29,13
And so I find that I find about 1.

313
05:58,29,13 --> 05:59,93,33
8 meters per second.

314
06:00,32,3 --> 06:02,16,13
So if I drop it from a height of 3 m,

315
06:02,16,13 --> 06:03,42,23
which I'm going to do,

316
06:03,42,23 --> 06:07,59,3
then you would think that the time that it takes to hit the floor would be about my 3 m

317
06:07,59,3 --> 06:10,39,13
divided by 1.8 m per second, which is about 1.

318
06:10,39,13 --> 06:11,68,43
7 seconds.

319
06:12,11,3 --> 06:12,61,53
That's not bad.

320
06:12,99,63 --> 06:14,38,43
That's not a bad approximation.

321
06:14,76,3 --> 06:16,21,13
However, it will of course take longer.

322
06:16,73,13 --> 06:18,52,23
And the reason why it will take longer is

323
06:18,52,23 --> 06:21,30,13
that the terminal velocity, the terminal speed is not achieved

324
06:21,30,13 --> 06:21,90,93
instantaneously.

325
06:22,46,83 --> 06:24,58,23
With the ball bearings, it was within 9 milliseconds.

326
06:24,58,23 --> 06:26,38,93
I can assure you that here it will take a lot longer.

327
06:26,95,53 --> 06:30,43,73
Now, if you want to calculate the time that it takes

328
06:30,43,73 --> 06:32,35,83
to get close to the terminal speed,

329
06:32,35,83 --> 06:33,83,83
that is not an easy task

330
06:33,83,83 --> 06:35,35,53
because

331
06:35,35,53 --> 06:37,17,83
you are going to end up with a

332
06:37,17,83 --> 06:38,71,63
nasty differential equation.

333
06:38,71,63 --> 06:39,88,43
You're going to get mg.

334
06:39,88,43 --> 06:43,66,83
You're going to get the acceleration, which is the result of let's go which equation we have.

335
06:44,3,3 --> 06:46,68,83
You see we have MA

336
06:46,68,83 --> 06:49,24,13
equals mg

337
06:49,24,13 --> 06:51,60,3
and then we get minus

338
06:51,60,3 --> 06:53,36,3
the resistive force.

339
06:53,46,93 --> 06:56,70,43
And the resistive force has a term in V

340
06:56,70,43 --> 06:58,20,13
and has a term in V squared.

341
06:58,58,3 --> 06:59,93,3
You see V and V squared.

342
06:59,93,3 --> 07:01,41,53
And so this cannot be solved analytically.

343
07:01,85,3 --> 07:05,62,33
But I've asked my graduate student Dave Pulley, who is one of your instructors,

344
07:05,62,33 --> 07:07,69,63
to solve this for me numerically.

345
07:08,53,3 --> 07:11,59,73
And I'm going to show you the results that he prepared.

346
07:11,59,73 --> 07:14,93,33
He has a nice view graph and you can see the effect of time

347
07:14,93,33 --> 07:17,73,33
on the ball if you drop it from

348
07:18,14,23 --> 07:19,14,3
3 meters.

349
07:19,47,53 --> 07:20,53,3
Here it is.

350
07:20,53,3 --> 07:22,59,53
All the numbers are there. This is on the web, so don't copy anything.

351
07:22,59,53 --> 07:27,16,33
Uh, you have the values for C1 and C2 are given at the top. You may not be able to see them from your seat, but they are there.

352
07:27,16,33 --> 07:32,13,53
And what you see here is the height above the ground as a function of time.

353
07:32,13,53 --> 07:34,19,23
This is 1 second, this is one and a half second. This is the 3 meter mark.

354
07:34,56,73 --> 07:38,63,53
If there were no air drag, remember we dropped an apple early on from 3 m, it will hit the floor

355
07:38,63,53 --> 07:40,58,43
at about 780 milliseconds.

356
07:41,53,3 --> 07:44,46,33
However, with the air drag, it will be about 1 second later,

357
07:44,46,33 --> 07:45,94,33
more like 1.8 seconds.

358
07:46,39,43 --> 07:48,29,93
So the 1.7 wasn't bad as you see.

359
07:48,29,93 --> 07:51,47,63
But if you look here at how the speed

360
07:51,47,63 --> 07:53,77,33
builds up as a function of time, you see it takes about three,

361
07:53,77,33 --> 07:55,18,83
40 of a second to build up

362
07:55,18,83 --> 07:59,15,43
to that terminal speed, which is the 1.8 m per second that you have there.

363
08:00,36,13 --> 08:04,32,93
And needless to say, of course, that the acceleration due to gravity does not remain constant,

364
08:04,32,93 --> 08:08,41,3
but goes down very quickly. And when the acceleration

365
08:08,41,3 --> 08:10,94,33
reaches approaches zero, then you have terminal speed,

366
08:10,94,33 --> 08:12,41,33
and then there is no longer any change

367
08:12,41,33 --> 08:13,47,93
in the velocity.

368
08:13,79,3 --> 08:14,65,63
So let's try this.

369
08:14,65,63 --> 08:15,45,23
Give more light.

370
08:15,90,23 --> 08:18,43,73
And we're going to throw this object and

371
08:18,43,73 --> 08:21,7,83
I don't think you're going to get 1.8 seconds. You may get something that is larger than 1.8 seconds.

372
08:21,7,83 --> 08:24,38,23
And the reasons are the following. Number one,

373
08:24,38,23 --> 08:25,79,33
this is not a perfect sphere.

374
08:26,35,3 --> 08:28,78,3
And only for spheres do these calculations hold.

375
08:28,78,3 --> 08:29,39,33
That's number one.

376
08:29,39,33 --> 08:32,20,43
Number two, this thing is very springy.

377
08:32,20,43 --> 08:35,21,93
So the moment that I let it go, it probably goes in some kind of oscillation.

378
08:35,21,93 --> 08:37,14,93
That doesn't help either. That will probably also slow it down.

379
08:37,72,43 --> 08:41,21,3
Because what causes, of course, this slowdown in regime 2 is really turbulence.

380
08:41,21,3 --> 08:43,22,13
Turbulence is extremely hard to understand and predict.

381
08:43,57,13 --> 08:46,76,13
And so almost anything I do, I will only add turbulence.

382
08:46,76,13 --> 08:50,52,63
And therefore I predict that the time that it will take from 3 m will be probably larger than 1.8 seconds.

383
08:50,88,13 --> 08:54,24,13
But it will be substantially larger than the 780 milliseconds,

384
08:54,57,43 --> 08:56,44,93
which is what you would have seen if you drop an apple.

385
08:56,88,73 --> 08:59,68,43
So let's see how close we are.

386
09:00,20,43 --> 09:02,10,93
Turn on this timer.

387
09:02,57,43 --> 09:03,98,33
Make sure I zero it. I did.

388
09:04,47,33 --> 09:05,18,63
And

389
09:05,18,63 --> 09:10,96,93
It's not too easy to release it, by the way, and start the timer at the same moment.

390
09:11,31,43 --> 09:13,52,83
And it's not even so easy for me to see when it hits the ground.

391
09:13,88,83 --> 09:15,95,83
So there's a huge uncertainty in this

392
09:16,20,23 --> 09:17,10,3
experiment.

393
09:17,54,3 --> 09:18,11,83
Okay.

394
09:18,68,3 --> 09:19,63,33
3 2 1 0

395
09:21,68,43 --> 09:22,36,13
What do we see?

396
09:23,48,3 --> 09:24,41,13
2.06

397
09:24,41,13 --> 09:25,52,83
Did I see something? 2.0, it's not bad.

398
09:26,71,83 --> 09:28,24,83
The prediction was 1.8, you get 2.0.

399
09:28,24,83 --> 09:31,74,43
That's not bad. So this takes the air drag into account and it is not even an approximation.

400
09:31,74,43 --> 09:35,25,33
It uses the entire term linear in V as well as in V squared, but it's almost exclusively dominated by the V squared term.

401
09:35,78,93 --> 09:40,71,33
I also asked Dave to show me what happens when I throw a pebble of the Empire State building.

402
09:40,71,33 --> 09:45,71,13
And the pebble that we chose was had a radius of 1 centimeter. It's a kind of pebble that all of us could find.

403
09:45,71,13 --> 09:47,63,73
I know roughly the density of pebbles.

404
09:47,99,3 --> 09:52,33,53
And if we throw it off the Empire State building, we reach a terminal speed

405
09:52,33,53 --> 09:55,82,73
of about 75 miles per hour.

406
09:56,19,3 --> 09:58,72,93
Without the air drag, we would have reached 200

407
09:58,72,93 --> 10:01,37,43
and 25 miles per hour.

408
10:01,89,73 --> 10:03,26,53
So I want to show you that too.

409
10:08,31,73 --> 10:13,52,33
So now you see the Empire state building which has a height of 475 m.

410
10:14,47,43 --> 10:15,91,23
So that's where you start at T0.

411
10:15,91,23 --> 10:18,86,33
This is 1 second, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 5 seconds,

412
10:18,86,33 --> 10:20,12,43
15 seconds.

413
10:20,65,3 --> 10:25,81,53
And if there had been no air drag, it would hit the ground a little less than 10 seconds.

414
10:25,81,53 --> 10:29,74,13
But now it will hit the ground more like 16, 17 seconds.

415
10:30,29,53 --> 10:33,76,23
And you see that the terminal speed builds up

416
10:33,76,23 --> 10:35,71,53
in about 5, 6 seconds.

417
10:35,71,53 --> 10:38,30,73
It's very close to the final value.

418
10:38,30,73 --> 10:41,98,13
And if there had been no air drag, then the speed at which it would hit the ground,

419
10:41,98,13 --> 10:44,58,53
it would of course grow linearly. and when it hits the ground,

420
10:44,58,53 --> 10:48,20,73
it would be somewhere here, which is 225 miles

421
10:48,20,73 --> 10:49,32,33
per hour.

422
10:49,32,33 --> 10:50,88,93
So you see there's even a pebble.

423
10:50,88,93 --> 10:55,82,33
You wouldn't expect to be to have a very large effect on air drag, it is huge

424
10:55,82,33 --> 10:59,69,53
provided that you throw it from a high building.

425
11:00,74,93 --> 11:07,31,63
Now you may remember that we dropped an apple from 3 meters

426
11:07,31,63 --> 11:14,15,3
and that we calculated the gravitational acceleration given the time that it takes to fall.

427
11:14,15,3 --> 11:16,93,13
That was one of your, one of the things you did in your assignment.

428
11:17,49,33 --> 11:19,62,93
We had 781 milliseconds, I think.

429
11:19,96,33 --> 11:22,10,13
And out of that, you can calculate G.

430
11:22,61,3 --> 11:25,90,63
Right? Because you know that 3 m is 1/2 GT squared.

431
11:26,35,83 --> 11:28,87,23
So I give you the three with an uncertainty, I give you the time,

432
11:28,87,23 --> 11:31,32,83
781 millisecond

433
11:31,60,93 --> 11:34,97,53
with an uncertainty of 2 millisecond, which we allowed out pops G.

434
11:35,75,93 --> 11:39,84,53
So I asked Dave, what is the effect of air drag on this apple?

435
11:39,84,53 --> 11:44,53,83
Is it was it a responsible thing for us to ignore that?

436
11:45,60,43 --> 11:52,46,43
The apple has a mass of 134 grams.

437
11:52,98,83 --> 11:54,17,53
It's easy to weigh, of course.

438
11:54,56,73 --> 11:57,31,73
So this was our apple during our first lecture.

439
11:57,99,93 --> 12:00,59,13
M is 134 grams.

440
12:01,55,3 --> 12:06,78,43
It's almost a sphere, really, not quite, but almost a sphere, and the radius is about 3 cm.

441
12:08,22,83 --> 12:12,91,33
And that leads to a terminal velocity which you can calculate if you want to,

442
12:12,91,33 --> 12:14,81,63
using the V squared term,

443
12:14,81,63 --> 12:17,98,3
but I was not interested in that.

444
12:18,35,93 --> 12:22,93,83
I wanted to know how many milliseconds is the touchdown delayed because of the air drag.

445
12:23,34,93 --> 12:27,48,13
And Dave made the calculations and he found

446
12:27,48,13 --> 12:31,38,93
that that is 2 milliseconds from 3 meters.

447
12:31,38,93 --> 12:33,12,13
From one and a half meters, it's almost nothing.

448
12:33,55,43 --> 12:37,98,23
And the reason why it's almost nothing from one and a half meters, you see,

449
12:37,98,23 --> 12:41,50,83
when you throw an apple in air,

450
12:41,50,83 --> 12:42,85,33
it's really in regime two.

451
12:43,25,13 --> 12:45,89,23
So you really dominated by the speed

452
12:45,89,23 --> 12:47,48,73
square term.

453
12:47,88,83 --> 12:52,4,83
And the first one and a half meters it doesn't get a very high speed yet. The speed

454
12:52,4,83 --> 12:58,73,73
grows linearly and so it is the last portion where you really get hit by the air drag by the V squared term.

455
12:59,28,3 --> 13:00,98,63
2 milliseconds

456
13:01,31,43 --> 13:02,73,3
from 3 meters.

457
13:02,73,3 --> 13:06,63,13
So if H is 3 m, there is a 2 millisecond,

458
13:06,63,13 --> 13:08,93,53
let's call it delay.

459
13:09,95,63 --> 13:14,68,53
So we were on the hairy edge of being lucky and unlucky.

460
13:15,20,53 --> 13:24,1,3
If you really want to recalculate the gravitational acceleration using our data, you should really subtract the 2 milliseconds from the time.

461
13:24,1,3 --> 13:31,9,43
On the other hand, since we allowed a 2 millisecond uncertainty, we really weren't too far off.

462
13:32,94,73 --> 13:40,83,83
Now comes my last part and that is how does air drag influence trajectories?

463
13:41,20,23 --> 13:46,84,93
And that is also part of your assignment, but I'm going to help you a little bit with that.

464
13:47,46,33 --> 13:54,73,23
In your assignment number four, I'm asking you to evaluate quantitatively

465
13:55,73,3 --> 14:00,26,13
the motion of an an object in liquid,

466
14:00,26,13 --> 14:07,7,23
but I give that object an initial speed in the X direction.

467
14:07,80,23 --> 14:11,64,93
And then there's the liquid below. Then gravity is there and there is that initial speed.

468
14:12,8,3 --> 14:16,21,43
If there were no drag, then this of course would be a parabola.

469
14:16,70,3 --> 14:21,71,43
And the horizontal velocity would always be the same. There would never be any change.

470
14:22,46,3 --> 14:23,90,53
But that's not the case now.

471
14:24,57,93 --> 14:31,41,33
Because of the resistive forces, because of the drag by the liquid, the object is going to

472
14:31,41,33 --> 14:39,29,33
get a velocity in this direction, so there's going to be a component of the resistive force opposing it.

473
14:39,74,33 --> 14:46,99,3
It has a speed in this direction, so there's also going to be a component of the resistive force in this direction.

474
14:47,34,63 --> 14:51,44,3
And that will decrease this speed, this component in the X direction.

475
14:51,84,3 --> 14:56,89,33
And so you can already see that the curve that you're going to see is very different one.

476
14:57,27,3 --> 15:01,32,63
It's going to look something like this.

477
15:01,93,93 --> 15:18,39,53
And then ultimately, there is nothing left of this component, and ultimately, when you go vertically down, you have the terminal speed that you can find from dropping an object just into the liquid vertically.

478
15:18,81,43 --> 15:22,62,63
So that's something you're going to deal with in your assignment number four,

479
15:22,62,63 --> 15:29,24,33
and this is exclusively done in regime one because we have an object with liquid.

480
15:29,24,33 --> 15:33,23,43
And with liquid you almost always work with regime one.

481
15:35,24,3 --> 15:39,82,23
Suppose I take a tennis ball and I throw up a tennis ball in 26 100.

482
15:40,17,3 --> 15:42,81,13
There is air drag on that tennis ball.

483
15:43,51,3 --> 15:47,51,13
In the absence of any air drag, I would get a nice parabola

484
15:47,51,13 --> 15:51,77,13
which would be completely symmetric.

485
15:52,79,63 --> 15:56,85,73
I throw it up with a certain initial speed

486
15:57,32,53 --> 16:00,97,73
V call it V0, I don't care.

487
16:01,54,13 --> 16:04,95,93
And the horizontal component would never change.

488
16:05,38,83 --> 16:08,57,73
This would be V0 X would always be the same.

489
16:08,57,73 --> 16:17,57,73
But now with air drag, you're going to see that there's going to be a force, an air drag force in the Y direction.

490
16:17,57,73 --> 16:21,22,63
If the object goes up in this direction, then there will be

491
16:21,22,63 --> 16:26,16,93
a resistive force component in the Y direction.

492
16:26,16,93 --> 16:28,45,73
And since it has a speed in this direction,

493
16:28,45,73 --> 16:33,99,3
there will also be a resistive force in the X direction.

494
16:33,99,3 --> 16:36,69,33
So this speed is going to be eaten up.

495
16:36,69,33 --> 16:40,47,33
In the same way that this component was going to be eaten up.

496
16:40,77,13 --> 16:44,50,13
This component is going to suffer. It will not stay constant throughout.

497
16:44,95,33 --> 16:52,90,13
And as a result of that, you're going to get a trajectory that looks more like this.

498
16:53,58,73 --> 16:54,89,33
It's asymmetric.

499
16:55,38,93 --> 17:00,96,53
Clearly, you don't reach the highest point that you would have reached without air drag,

500
17:01,14,3 --> 17:06,69,93
for the reason that this resistive force in the Y direction will not allow it to go as high,

501
17:06,69,93 --> 17:07,44,73
that's obvious.

502
17:07,78,53 --> 17:10,63,33
You don't go as far as you would without air drag,

503
17:10,63,33 --> 17:15,80,13
for obvious reasons that this resistive force is going to kill this speed,

504
17:15,80,13 --> 17:22,13,23
but you also will get asymmetry in the curvature. And I want you to see that.

505
17:22,66,23 --> 17:27,39,33
I call this point O, this point P, and let's call this point S.

506
17:27,39,33 --> 17:30,73,73
So what I will do is I will throw up a tennis ball,

507
17:31,1,23 --> 17:33,57,33
and then I will throw up a styrofoam ball.

508
17:33,86,93 --> 17:38,40,33
And the styrofoam ball has very closely the same radius as the tennis ball.

509
17:38,72,23 --> 17:43,82,53
That means the resistive force is the same on both, because the resistive force

510
17:44,14,83 --> 17:49,54,33
is only dictated by r squared and by V. R square V squared, remember?

511
17:49,54,33 --> 17:53,94,33
However, this has a way larger mass than this one.

512
17:54,35,43 --> 18:01,34,33
And even though the resistive forces will be closely the same if I throw them up with the same initial speed, it has a way larger effect on a smaller mass than on a larger mass.

513
18:01,34,33 --> 18:17,61,23
F equals MA, right? So on a very large mass, the resistive force will have a much lower effect than on the smaller mass, even though the resistive forces are about the same.

514
18:17,94,93 --> 18:22,73,73
So, try to see that the tennis ball is very close to an ideal parabola.

515
18:22,73,73 --> 18:26,8,33
You will not even see any effect of asymmetry. It will not be the case for the starfoam though.

516
18:26,8,33 --> 18:31,63,53
So look at the tennis ball first.

517
18:34,42,73 --> 18:36,12,33
I should really do it here.

518
18:37,10,23 --> 18:38,49,83
Did it look more or less symmetric?

519
18:38,80,33 --> 18:40,18,83
Okay, now I'll try this one.

520
18:42,12,3 --> 18:43,57,33
Did it look asymmetric?

521
18:44,20,43 --> 18:45,69,83
Could you see it?

522
18:46,33,73 --> 18:48,78,23
Are you just saying yes or you really saw it?

523
18:49,16,63 --> 18:51,12,33
Let me do it once more. I can throw it back.

524
18:52,59,3 --> 18:56,16,33
So now it should curve like this and then sort of come down like that. You ready?

525
18:58,46,13 --> 19:01,15,23
You see the asymmetry?

526
19:02,93,3 --> 19:04,53,93
Okay, now comes my last question.

527
19:04,88,73 --> 19:07,51,13
I'm going to ask you the following, and there is a unique answer to that.

528
19:07,51,13 --> 19:13,15,23
I want you to think about it and I want you to be able to give that answer with total 100% confidence.

529
19:13,93,33 --> 19:18,83,93
When this object goes from O to P, that takes a certain amount of time.

530
19:19,57,73 --> 19:25,41,63
When it goes from P to S back to the ground, that takes also a certain amount of time.

531
19:26,58,93 --> 19:28,83,33
Is this time the same as this time?

532
19:29,73,13 --> 19:34,17,43
Or is this time longer than this time? Or is this time shorter?

533
19:34,91,3 --> 19:37,70,93
Think about it. See you Friday.
