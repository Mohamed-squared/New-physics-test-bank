1
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,100
Peace be upon you.

2
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,500
In the last two videos, we talked about properties 1 through 9.

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:33,500
In this video, God willing, today we will continue our discussion about the properties of numbers. We will also cover the three remaining properties we have, which are 10, 11, and 12.

4
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:42,800
All the previous properties dealt with equalities. Meaning, if we looked at all the equations we had, they dealt with the equal sign.

5
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:55,800
The properties we have today will deal with inequalities. For example, we say that A is greater than B, and B is less than A, or that A is... A is less than B, and so on.

6
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:02,700
The importance of inequalities in the properties of numbers becomes very clear when we work with zero.

7
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:12,300
Meaning, if I said that A is greater than 0, or that A is less than 0, from this statement, I can say that A is positive or A is negative. Meaning...

8
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:25,900
If I were to place this on the number line and say here is zero, the numbers on this side, we say A is greater than 0. The numbers on the other side, we say A is less than 0. So, these numbers are the positive numbers, and these numbers are the negative numbers.

9
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,800
And... what I just said specifically is the first property we have, which is property...

10
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:55,800
The tenth one, which says: for every number A, only one of the following holds.

11
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,700
Meaning, for any number A, only one of the three things I'm about to list is true.

12
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,100
First thing: A equals 0.

13
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,800
Second possibility: A is in P. What is this P? It's the positive numbers.

14
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,000
Meaning, I'm saying that A is in the positive numbers, or greater than 0.

15
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:28,200
The third possibility: negative A is in P.

16
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:42,600
Very simply put, the truth is we say that for any number I have, this number will either be zero, or it will be in the positive numbers (meaning it will be greater than zero), or its negative will be greater than zero.

17
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,800
This part, we need to pause on for a bit. What is this concept of a negative number being in the positive set?

18
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,200
We know that negative is always less than zero.

19
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:01,500
And here we need to pause a bit to reorganize our thoughts regarding the aspect of 'negative'. What does 'negative' mean?

20
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:07,000
We always think that 'negative' means a number less than zero. And that's correct...

21
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,900
...to a large extent, until we start talking about this type of mathematical analysis. Meaning, for example, we can say that the positive set...

22
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,900
...contains a number like 3, and the negative set contains a number like negative 3.

23
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,500
But actually, the meaning of 'negative' is a bit deeper than that. 'Negative' means the inverse of the number. Meaning...

24
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,100
...the number could be greater than zero or less than zero. The 'negative'...

25
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:40,900
...flips it to the other side. Meaning, I can say that the negative of negative 3 is 3, and the negative of 3 is negative 3. Meaning...

26
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,600
...if I said A equals, for example, 5.

27
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,200
Then in this case, negative A equals negative 5.

28
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:58,300
But if A was originally negative 5 from the start, then in this case, negative A equals negative (-5), which equals 5.

29
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,100
So I flipped negative 5 to 5. So...

30
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:10,500
...in short, 'negative' is the inverse of the number, whether that number was originally positive or negative. If it was positive, the inverse flips it to negative.

31
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:16,200
And if it was negative, the inverse flips it to positive. Therefore, this statement means...

32
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:26,400
...that 'negative A is in P' means that A itself was originally less than zero; it was already in the negative set. So, applying 'negative' put it in the positive set.

33
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:32,900
And this is a very important concept, keep it in mind because we won't just use it in this video, we will use it in the rest of the course, God willing.

34
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:42,400
Okay, the next property... properties 11 and 12 are very easy, so we'll write them together like this, one after the other.

35
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:55,300
Property 11 says: if A and B are in P. What does 'in P' mean? It means in the positive numbers, meaning greater than 0.

36
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:05,700
If this statement is true, then A + B is in P.

37
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,300
The next property, property 12, says...

38
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:23,700
...also the same system: if A and B are in P...

39
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:32,400
...then A * B is in P.

40
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:40,600
What does this mean in short? It means if I have A and B, both in the positive set (both greater than zero), then when you add them together, you get a positive number.

41
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,900
Same system: if you multiply them together, you also get a positive number, which will even be greater than the positive number resulting from their sum.

42
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:57,900
Okay, there's a definition we want to work with, but before we work with it, we want to deduce it. Meaning...

43
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:14,400
If we said that... let's say, for example, that A - B is greater than 0.

44
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:20,600
This 'greater than' sign, we treat it exactly the same way as the 'equal' sign. Meaning I can work with it using the same...

45
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,400
...the same balance I used with the 'equal' sign. Meaning, I can say...

46
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:38,400
...I want to get rid of this B, so I'll add a positive B to it. So I'll say A - B + B on this side, and the other side will be 0 + B.

47
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,800
When I remove these together because they become zero, then A, in this case, is greater than B.

48
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:55,400
So, when A - B is positive (greater than zero), it means that A must be greater than B. And this is the first definition we have.

49
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:03,500
The definition says that... I won't write it in the 'if... then...' format, let's just put it directly. We'll say, for example, that A...

50
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:15,400
...is greater than B means (and it goes both ways, meaning in both directions) that A - B is greater than 0. And the reverse is true.

51
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:25,100
Meaning, if A is less than B, it means that B - A is the one greater than 0.

52
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,600
You can even deduce this the same way I deduced the previous one.

53
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,700
Okay, let's work through an example.

54
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:43,500
Okay, let's assume that A is less than B, and that B is less than C.

55
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:52,400
This is like what? Like Ahmed is shorter than Mohamed, and Mohamed is shorter than Ali, so surely Ahmed is shorter than Ali. That's what I want to prove.

56
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:58,000
I want to prove that A is less than C. This is the part I want to prove.

57
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Okay, let's work on this. From this definition, this means that B - A is greater than 0. In other words, I moved the A to the other side.

58
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:15,400
And this is the same system, it means that C - B is also greater than 0.

59
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:24,400
Okay, this means that this whole business, B - A, since it's greater than 0, it means it's positive. And C - B, since it's greater than 0, means it's positive. Here I'm saying if I have positive and positive, adding them gives me positive.

60
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:42,400
This means I know from these two that (B - A) + (C - B), this expression, is greater than 0.

61
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,000
Okay, the B and negative B will cancel out. You are left with C and negative A. So, C - A...

62
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,000
...is greater than 0.

63
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,600
Move the A to the other side, so C is greater than A.

64
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:07,900
Or, you can derive it directly from the definition here, or you can also say this is the same as A is less than C, which is what I wanted to prove from the beginning.

65
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,100
Okay, maybe we can even take another example.

66
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,100
Okay.

67
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:26,400
The topic of negative A being positive, or greater than 0, if A was originally less than 0...

68
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,500
...is very important for us in our discussion about absolute values. Why?

69
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,700
What are absolute values? Let's just quickly review absolute values. Absolute values mean, if I have, for example, a number like 3...

70
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:48,000
...its absolute value, we said, is 3. And if the absolute value of a number like negative 3, it also becomes 3. Okay.

71
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:55,800
Based on this, how do I write the mathematical notation for the absolute value?

72
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:07,400
Using this concept and what's in front of me, I can say that the absolute value of something like a number A will be as follows: it will be A...

73
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,100
...or negative A.

74
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:17,000
It is A if A itself was originally greater than or equal to 0.

75
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:24,000
And it will be negative A if A itself was originally less than or equal to 0. Meaning...

76
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:39,900
Here, when 3 was greater than zero, its absolute value was itself. So A was greater than zero, thus its absolute value was A itself, which is the example of 3 here.

77
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:54,900
In this case [referring to -3], negative A [meaning the original number A, which was -3] was less than zero. Consequently, its absolute value was the negative of negative 3, which is negative A (meaning negative of -3). Thus, it gave me the positive of negative 3, which is its inverse.

78
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:04,800
Okay, this part is quite important because we will use it in the upcoming proof of the first theorem. What is this theorem about?

79
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:14,300
The theorem says... this will be Theorem 1.

80
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:32,900
Theorem 1 says that the absolute value of (A + B) must be less than or equal to the absolute value of A alone plus the absolute value of B alone.

81
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:43,700
What does 'theorem' mean? It means someone is stating a rule. And for us to believe this person, follow them, consider this rule correct, and start using it as a law, we must prove it.

82
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,600
And that's what we will do in the remaining part of the video.

83
00:11:48,700 --> 00:12:02,000
Okay, to prove something like this, we must... look at this value... work on this side alone, and work on this side alone, and compare them.

84
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:14,600
Okay, what are the possibilities for this? The possibilities for A and B, generally, are either they are positive or negative. Of course, it doesn't matter to us if it's zero, because it's known that the absolute value of zero is zero.

85
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:22,900
This is always zero, so we'll exclude it from the calculation for now, meaning we won't include it in the calculation right now. We'll work with greater than zero and less than zero. Okay.

86
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,000
Let's draw a line here.

87
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:44,300
The possibilities for A and B are as follows: either A is positive and B is also positive, or A is positive and B is negative, or A is negative and B is positive, or both are negative.

88
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,200
Both less than zero.

89
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:55,500
Let's take the first example. Let's number them so they are clear.

90
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,400
This is one, two, three, four.

91
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,500
Okay.

92
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,800
Let's take the first example. A and B are both positive. Okay.

93
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:17,300
Positive + positive, from property number 11, when I add positive to positive, the number inside becomes positive. This means...

94
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:26,500
...since the number inside is positive, I apply this part of the notation. So the absolute value of this whole thing comes out as it is, because its value is positive.

95
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,800
Consequently, this part comes down as A + B. Done.

96
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:44,900
This is the same system. A, we said A is positive. Therefore, since it's positive, its result as an absolute value will be positive. And B, the same system. B was positive, we agreed on that here from the first possibility, that it's positive.

97
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:54,400
Consequently, its value also comes out positive, or rather, as it is. So, here A will be A, and B will be B.

98
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:05,500
Therefore, A + B and A + B... these two are equal to each other.

99
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:12,300
And indeed, the theorem tells me that this is less than or equal to this side. So, so far, the theorem holds.

100
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,000
Okay, let's take case number four. This was case number one. Let's take case number four.

101
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:28,600
Case number four tells me that both are negative. Okay. When this is negative, and this is negative, negative plus negative gives you negative. So, initially, we will apply...

102
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:37,900
...A + B, we know its result is negative. Therefore, we apply... 'negative' means less than zero, so we take its negative to be the absolute value.

103
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:44,800
So, the business here will be negative (A + B). This is the absolute value of A + B.

104
00:14:45,000 --> 00:15:02,500
Why? Because we know that A + B, since A is negative and B is negative, when you add them, you get negative. And as long as this sum inside is negative, you apply this part of the rule because it's less than zero. So its absolute value is its negative. Thus, it's negative (A + B).

105
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:16,600
Same system here. This is A, but we know A is less than zero. Consequently, its absolute value will be negative A. Plus, the absolute value of B, also because it's negative, will be negative B.

106
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,500
Okay, let's expand this. This will be negative A, negative B.

107
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,200
This is negative A + negative B, meaning negative B.

108
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:33,800
Negative A, negative B; negative A, negative B. This expression equals this expression. So, it also holds.

109
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,500
Okay, now let's work on example two.

110
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:48,600
Let's work on the second example or possibility: A is positive and B is negative.

111
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:58,900
Okay, when I have a positive number and I add a negative number to it, will the overall result be positive or negative? The problem is I don't know. It could turn out positive, or it could turn out negative. Let's use a small example.

112
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,000
If I said I have 3 + (-1), this equals 2.

113
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:17,300
And if I said 3 + (-4), this equals -1. So this is positive, and this is negative. So I don't know. I might have a number... the result here could be positive or could be negative. So we must work through both possibilities. Okay.

114
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:25,100
Let's first assume it's positive. So let's apply this. In this case, the result here will come out as it is: A + B.

115
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:34,700
Why? Because I assumed the result here is positive, greater than zero. Consequently, its absolute value will come out as it is, the value inside, which is A + B. Okay, on this side...

116
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:46,800
...we are in this example. So A is positive, its absolute value will be A. Plus, B is negative, so its absolute value is its negative. So here, negative B.

117
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:56,600
Okay, so this can be simplified to A - B. And on this side, we have A + B.

118
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:06,600
Okay, let's remove A opposite A. I'm left with B here and negative B here. The question here is...

119
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:17,400
...which one is greater? B or negative B? Let's go back to the original value. What was B originally at the beginning? It was negative, it was less than zero.

120
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:25,100
Consequently, its negative became positive. So this number [-B] is surely greater than this number [B].

121
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:41,700
So B is less than negative B, because B itself was less than zero. Its negative [-B] is definitely positive, based on the properties we discussed. So indeed, B, which came from this side, is less than negative B, which came from this side. Thus, the property indeed holds.

122
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:50,200
This is in the case where the work inside, or the business here, had a value that was positive.

123
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,100
Let's try it if it were negative.

124
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,200
If it were negative, then this part would apply, so it would be negative (A + B).

125
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:12,000
And in this case, the part here will come out as it is, it will be A - B. Because, as it is, A is positive and B is negative. Okay.

126
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:18,500
The part here then is negative A, negative B. And the other side will be A, negative B.

127
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,200
Okay, let's remove negative B with negative B. I'm left with negative A versus A. The question here: is negative A greater...

128
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:38,000
...or is A greater? Let's go back to the origin. What was A? A was positive because it was greater than zero. Consequently, A here... its negative will be the one less than zero. So surely this A is greater than negative A.

129
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:44,800
And indeed, negative A represents this side [- (A+B)], and A represents this side [A + |-B| when result is negative, simplified relative comparison]. Thus, the property also holds.

130
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:57,900
The third possibility, we don't need to work through it because it's the same. All we do is swap: instead of A being positive and B negative, A will be negative and B positive. And it will also turn out the same result in the end.

131
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:06,800
So, by applying the four possibilities for the values of A and B, whether positive or negative, we have proven that the first theorem we have in this course holds in all possibilities.

132
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,400
And with that, we have reached the end of Chapter 1.

133
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:29,100
We talked about 12 properties, considered the basic properties of numbers. We started with four properties for addition, مقابلهم (mirrored by) four similar ones with a slight modification for multiplication, and then the ninth property which combined both addition and multiplication.

134
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:40,000
And today, in this video, we talked about the last three properties, which relate to inequalities. Their importance was specifically in differentiating between positive and negative numbers, and their relationship with zero, of course.

135
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:46,300
And we concluded it with the theorem related to the absolute value.

136
00:19:48,300 --> 00:20:04,500
The names of the properties - it would be great if you knew them. I won't focus on them in this video; they are presented before you. Each property has a name it's known by. If you can link the name to the property, that's good. If you can't, well, it's not essential.

137
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:12,500
The most important thing is that the property itself and its meaning are present in your mind, and you can recall it when you need it, especially in the videos we will talk about, God willing, in the future.

138
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:28,700
The author concluded his words in the chapter, the first chapter, with a question: Are the 12 properties we discussed, are they all the properties we need to deal with numbers? The answer is no.

139
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,600
In reality, not only are the properties insufficient, but the numbers themselves are insufficient.

140
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:49,300
Meaning, we will have to expand our concept of numbers and add new types of numbers. And from here on out, we must be a bit careful in our dealings and our use of the word 'number'. We must understand which type of number we are talking about.

141
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,200
The 12 properties have issues when dealing with numbers in their current state.

142
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:06,000
The next chapter will focus on clarifying what the problems are and what shortcoming exists in these 12 properties when dealing with numbers.

143
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:12,200
After that, God willing, Part 2 of the book, specifically from Chapter 3 to Chapter 8, will talk about...

144
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:20,300
...what the new properties are, and what are the new types of numbers that will address the deficiencies we will see, God willing, in the next chapter.

145
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,400
See you in the next video, God willing. Peace be upon you.
