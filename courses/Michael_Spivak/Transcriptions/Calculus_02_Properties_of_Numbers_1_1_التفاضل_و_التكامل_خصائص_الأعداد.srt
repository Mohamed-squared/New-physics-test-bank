0:0:18,450 --> 0:0:19,280
Peace be upon you.

2
0:0:20,150 --> 0:0:28,100
This video, God willing, will be the beginning of our discussion about the Calculus course, which we agreed we would work on from Michael Spivak's Calculus book.

3
0:0:28,350 --> 0:0:40,810
As we agreed in the previous introduction, which we talked about in the last video, to understand Calculus well, with its two main branches, differentiation and integration, we must have a deep and strong understanding of limits.

4
0:0:41,130 --> 0:0:44,780
And to understand limits well, we must understand real numbers well.

5
0:0:44,780 --> 0:0:50,10
And to understand real numbers well, we must understand the building blocks of real numbers, which are numbers.

6
0:0:50,300 --> 0:0:55,160
This is the part that the first chapter, the first chapter of this book, covers, which is the Properties of Numbers.

7
0:0:55,160 --> 0:0:57,300
Specifically, there are 12 properties.

8
0:0:59,140 --> 0:1:1,160
So, what is this topic of Properties of Numbers?

9
0:1:1,160 --> 0:1:13,690
As we will see from the moment I start working on them, it's information we already know, things we studied when we were young, or things we've known automatically since we were young, without even thinking about it while performing arithmetic operations.

10
0:1:14,350 --> 0:1:25,930
In reality, our work on the Properties of Numbers isn't just a review of what we knew as kids; it's more of a deeper look into the fundamental concepts upon which the rules governing how we work with numbers are built.

11
0:1:26,720 --> 0:1:31,500
Meaning, if I perform any arithmetic operation like those we do in mathematics generally,

12
0:1:37,500 --> 0:1:46,170
no arithmetic operation, whether in arithmetic, algebra, or trigonometry, can conflict in any way with the properties we will discuss.

13
0:1:46,170 --> 0:1:49,510
And not only that, it must comply with *all* the properties.

14
0:1:49,510 --> 0:1:57,430
Meaning, if it works with property one but not with property four, it means there's a contradiction, the calculation is wrong, and it needs addressing.

15
0:1:58,160 --> 0:2:0,510
Okay, let's work on the properties. The first property we have says...

16
0:2:3,420 --> 0:2:5,270
Let's give an example first.

17
0:2:5,740 --> 0:2:10,900
If we say, for instance, we have 2 + 3 + 4, and I told you to perform this calculation.

18
0:2:10,900 --> 0:2:15,880
We all know we'd say 2 + 3 is 5, and 4 makes 9.

19
0:2:16,590 --> 0:2:20,80
Or someone else might say 3 + 4 is 7, and 2 makes 9.

20
0:2:0,670 --> 0:2:29,240
Whether you did the first part first then added the other, or did the second part first then added the two, in both cases, the result is correct, and this is the first property.

21
0:2:30,220 --> 0:2:40,620
The first property, which is P1, says: If a, b, and c are any numbers, then...

22
0:2:55,510 --> 0:2:59,950
Let's... write the rule now in another color...

23
0:3:1,550 --> 0:3:14,0
Then a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c. And I'll put the parentheses like this.

24
0:3:14,0 --> 0:3:18,610
The parentheses here mean the priority in the arithmetic operation performed on this expression.

25
0:3:18,610 --> 0:3:25,20
Meaning, I'm saying these parentheses indicate I'll finish what's inside this parenthesis first, which is b and c first, and then add their result to a.

26
0:3:25,20 --> 0:3:28,300
Or, I finish a and b first, and then add c to their result.

27
0:3:28,300 --> 0:3:36,340
In other words, we're saying the grouping, or association, in the addition operation doesn't matter; it gives me the same result in the end.

28
0:3:37,250 --> 0:3:44,610
What I did with three numbers can be proven for four, five, six, or a million numbers, but of course, it wouldn't be practical.

29
0:3:44,790 --> 0:3:55,990
You can actually use this first rule, or property, to deduce that the same rule applies to any number of numbers being added together. But of course, that would be a rigorous proof here before me... I don't think we need to work through it.

30
0:3:55,990 --> 0:4:4,940
If you can look it up from another source, that would be good. It's a nice thing to look at if you have some free time.

31
0:4:6,70 --> 0:4:11,160
The second property. The second property talks about a rule we also all know, which says...

32
0:4:12,250 --> 0:4:19,160
That anything added to zero gives me the same thing, or if zero is added to anything, it gives me the same thing.

33
0:4:20,400 --> 0:4:26,290
And this, by the way, is an important property despite its simplicity, and we'll use it a lot in our upcoming work, God willing.

34
0:4:26,810 --> 0:4:33,630
The property says: If a is any number, then...

35
0:4:41,250 --> 0:4:50,360
a + 0 = 0 + a = a.

36
0:4:52,860 --> 0:5:2,230
Meaning, as we said, zero added to anything gives me... sorry, zero added to anything, or anything added to zero, gives me the same number.

37
0:5:2,640 --> 0:5:8,150
This property is very important because it talks about a very important concept in mathematics, which is the existence of identity.

38
0:5:8,150 --> 0:5:11,820
Meaning, the identity of a specific operation. What does that mean?

39
0:5:13,200 --> 0:5:16,930
In the operation of addition, what is the number... which turned out to be zero here?

40
0:5:16,930 --> 0:5:21,520
What is the number that, when I add it to any number, gives me the same result as that number?

41
0:5:21,520 --> 0:5:27,180
Meaning, the number that goes in comes out the same. 'a' went in, 'a' came out. 'a' went in, 'a' came out.

42
0:5:27,180 --> 0:5:30,860
Therefore, we call this the identity or the existence of identity.

43
0:5:31,670 --> 0:5:34,140
So, the identity here in the addition operation is zero.

44
0:5:34,140 --> 0:5:37,540
Zero is considered the identity of the addition operation.

45
0:5:38,70 --> 0:5:45,460
Okay, property 3. Property 3 is also one of the important properties, and we'll use it a lot in this video and upcoming videos, God willing.

46
0:5:46,450 --> 0:6:9,400
P3 says: For every number a, there is a number -a such that...

47
0:6:12,470 --> 0:6:16,950
Such that what? This is also a property we all know.

48
0:6:17,620 --> 0:6:27,490
a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0.

49
0:6:28,280 --> 0:6:30,720
This property is extremely important. It tells me:

50
0:6:31,640 --> 0:6:36,610
any number, any number that comes to your mind, has a negative, has an opposite number.

51
0:6:37,150 --> 0:6:40,830
We call this the reverse (additive inverse) of number a.

52
0:6:41,260 --> 0:6:42,960
By the way, number 'a' doesn't have to be positive.

53
0:6:42,960 --> 0:6:50,700
Meaning, if I said... 3, what's the negative of 3? It's -3.

54
0:6:51,280 --> 0:6:56,500
Or -3, what's its negative? It's 3, because negative negative is positive.

55
0:6:56,500 --> 0:6:57,760
Okay? That's a point.

56
0:6:58,670 --> 0:7:4,930
Let's use these three properties to prove something we all know.

57
0:7:6,220 --> 0:7:12,600
Let's say, for example, if we want to say... let's use the green color.

58
0:7:13,230 --> 0:7:21,220
If we want to say that a + x = a.

59
0:7:22,230 --> 0:7:30,910
We all know that if I have 'a' and the result is 'a', it means I added zero to it. So, this 'x' must be zero.

60
0:7:31,200 --> 0:7:45,670
Therefore, if I can use the properties before me, these properties, to prove that x equals zero, then I'm sure that these properties are correct, and it's a kind of proof that these properties are correct and don't contradict each other.

61
0:7:46,660 --> 0:7:49,150
Okay, let's see how to do this.

62
0:7:50,30 --> 0:7:51,840
First, I want to find the value of x here.

63
0:7:51,840 --> 0:7:54,110
Okay, to find the value of x, I need to get rid of 'a'.

64
0:7:54,110 --> 0:7:56,890
Okay, which of the properties before me gets rid of 'a'?

65
0:7:56,890 --> 0:8:4,100
Property 3, because it tells me if you have a number and you add its inverse, or add it to its negative, you get zero.

66
0:8:4,430 --> 0:8:19,240
So let's put negative 'a' here + bring these down as they are a + x = a, but in this case, we must add negative 'a' to 'a' because we added negative 'a' to this side. Okay.

67
0:8:20,120 --> 0:8:24,700
This part is done; it's already present here in property 3, telling me it equals zero.

68
0:8:24,700 --> 0:8:27,970
So this will come down as zero. What do I do with these?

69
0:8:28,340 --> 0:8:38,340
For these, we can use property 1, the grouping property, which says (-a + a), put them first, finish them first together, and then add x to them.

70
0:8:39,320 --> 0:8:40,910
Okay, the zero comes down as is.

71
0:8:41,410 --> 0:8:48,120
This, from the third property, tells me this is zero + + x comes down as is.

72
0:8:48,490 --> 0:8:51,340
Okay, now it's time for the second property.

73
0:8:51,340 --> 0:8:56,980
The second property tells me 0 + a gives me a, so 0 + x gives me x = 0.

74
0:8:57,290 --> 0:9:5,650
This means I have proven that x equals 0. So the three properties work and don't contradict each other, at least in this example.

75
0:9:6,430 --> 0:9:13,480
Of course, you'll notice I did a somewhat lengthy proof. I could have shortened it to one step, and maybe I didn't even need to shorten it.

76
0:9:14,80 --> 0:9:16,850
But this way of working, this method of analysis, is important.

77
0:9:16,850 --> 0:9:28,840
You need to start getting used to it because we will work this way a lot in Calculus, especially when we want to derive the mathematical reasoning behind the rules we will deduce, God willing, during the course.

78
0:9:30,170 --> 0:9:34,300
We have one last property left for addition, which is property number four. P4.

79
0:9:37,290 --> 0:9:42,510
P4 says... P4 is considered an extension of P1.

80
0:9:42,740 --> 0:9:49,200
In P1, you'll notice I didn't say, for example, I didn't give you in the example that 'a' is added to 'c' first and then 'b'.

81
0:9:49,200 --> 0:9:52,910
Because here, I wasn't concerned with the order; I was concerned with grouping.

82
0:9:53,400 --> 0:9:54,590
Arrangement is another topic.

83
0:9:54,780 --> 0:9:56,760
P4 talks about arrangement.

84
0:9:57,160 --> 1:0:10,380
P4 says: If a and b are any numbers, then...

85
1:0:14,720 --> 1:0:16,510
Then a + b = b + a.

86
1:0:16,510 --> 1:0:18,30
We need to pause on this one a bit.

87
1:0:18,30 --> 1:0:22,520
Of course, we all know that order doesn't matter in addition.

88
1:0:22,520 --> 1:0:28,790
But in subtraction, the situation is different. Meaning, here...

89
1:0:33,350 --> 1:0:39,160
I can say, for example, let's give an example with the color... let's add another color.

90
1:0:40,560 --> 1:0:46,230
I can say, for example, that 3 + 2 = 2 + 3.

91
1:0:46,530 --> 1:0:50,890
In this case, this is five, and in this case, this is also five. No problem with that.

92
1:0:51,860 --> 1:1:2,20
But I cannot say that 3 - 2 = 2 - 3. This and these are not equal to each other.

93
1:1:5,500 --> 1:1:7,380
However, there's an exception.

94
1:1:7,610 --> 1:1:14,810
I mean, I can say that a - b = b - a in only one case: when a = b.

95
1:1:19,20 --> 1:1:25,140
Meaning, if a is three and b is three, then 3 - 3 = 3 - 3, so a - b = b - a.

96
1:1:25,140 --> 1:1:34,640
Of course, the topic... you might feel I'm going in circles, but this is an important point, a very important point. Why?

97
1:1:35,220 --> 1:1:45,470
This rule, despite its simplicity, none of the four properties before me can prove it.

98
1:1:45,860 --> 1:1:52,570
And here, the reason why we work with these properties starts to emerge, because of examples like this.

99
1:1:53,240 --> 1:1:57,620
The property before me, I can prove it using the properties of multiplication.

100
1:1:57,620 --> 1:2:0,730
I cannot prove it using the properties before me [for addition]. Therefore, it's necessary...

101
1:2:0,730 --> 1:2:5,930
Now I've encountered a case that has no proof within my [current set of] properties.

102
1:2:5,930 --> 1:2:12,30
So, the mathematicians have one of two solutions: either they invent new numbers, or they find a property that addresses this issue.

103
1:2:12,30 --> 1:2:14,800
And this is the important part I want to convey to you.

104
1:2:15,140 --> 1:2:19,930
So, consequently, there are properties later on that will resolve this dilemma here.

105
1:2:20,230 --> 1:2:28,810
We will see them, God willing, when we talk about the property... this will become clear in property number nine when we combine multiplication and addition, God willing.

106
1:2:29,520 --> 1:2:32,630
Okay, these are the four properties of addition.

107
1:2:33,90 --> 1:2:39,50
Similar to them are four other properties, numbers 5, 6, 7, and 8, for multiplication. Let's go see them now.

108
1:2:45,570 --> 1:2:52,720
Okay, we erased the expressions for the four properties of addition. And we put properties 5, 6, 7, and 8.

109
1:2:57,40 --> 1:3:6,910
But we didn't remove the wording because, frankly, the properties of multiplication are almost the same as the properties of addition, with slight differences, as we'll see shortly. Okay.

110
1:3:7,520 --> 1:3:13,550
The first property in multiplication, which is property number five, says: If a, b, and c are any numbers, then...

111
1:3:13,550 --> 1:3:16,980
Same as property number one for addition, but we'll do it for multiplication.

112
1:3:16,980 --> 1:3:22,360
It says that a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c.

113
1:3:22,700 --> 1:3:31,320
And again, we say that grouping in the multiplication operation doesn't affect the result. Meaning, we can do it with any grouping, just like addition.

114
1:3:31,770 --> 1:3:34,700
Of course, there's a point here, which is about this dot.

115
1:3:34,900 --> 1:3:36,860
If you haven't seen this notation before,

116
1:3:37,130 --> 1:3:42,820
multiplication can be written like this [dot], like this [cross], or like this [parentheses/juxtaposition].

117
1:3:43,150 --> 1:3:46,500
These two methods [dot and juxtaposition] are the ones we'll use frequently.

118
1:3:46,750 --> 1:3:48,220
We won't use this [cross] very often.

119
1:3:50,170 --> 1:3:54,560
The second property, just as there was an identity for addition, there's an identity for multiplication.

120
1:3:54,560 --> 1:3:55,690
What is the identity?

121
1:3:55,980 --> 1:4:2,470
The identity asks, what number, when I multiply it by any number, 'a', gives me 'a'?

122
1:4:3,110 --> 1:4:4,80
That number is one. Therefore...

123
1:4:6,680 --> 1:4:9,160
So, one is the identity of multiplication.

124
1:4:9,500 --> 1:4:12,680
I think this part is clear, no problem with it.

125
1:4:13,540 --> 1:4:19,820
Property number seven, we modified it slightly from property number three which was for addition.

126
1:4:19,820 --> 1:4:25,200
Here, the condition is "For every number a," but 'a' cannot be zero, specifically in this case.

127
1:4:25,740 --> 1:4:35,830
"There is a number..." In this case, it won't be negative 'a' either; in this case, it will be... forget this, it will be a to the power of -1, such that...

128
1:4:36,610 --> 1:4:38,80
What do we want to do here?

129
1:4:38,80 --> 1:4:40,990
This property number seven corresponds to property number three.

130
1:4:40,990 --> 1:4:47,310
And property number three was the inverse, the opposite, which ultimately gives me... meaning, it cancels out the number I have.

131
1:4:47,580 --> 1:4:52,50
Last time, we said a + (-a) was equal to zero.

132
1:4:52,450 --> 1:5:4,670
Here, 'a', when you multiply it by its inverse, which is a to the power of -1, will of course equal... the different order... will equal one.

133
1:5:5,430 --> 1:5:7,620
First, what is this a to the power of -1?

134
1:5:8,660 --> 1:5:11,50
a to the power of -1 equals 1/a.

135
1:5:11,50 --> 1:5:17,10
When we have a number over a number... meaning, the number one over the number below it, we can write it like this.

136
1:5:17,10 --> 1:5:20,830
And if we have 1/a^2, we can write it as a to the power of -2, and so on.

137
1:5:21,870 --> 1:5:31,560
So, this essentially says that a... the part written before me says that 'a' multiplied by 1/a equals a/a, and anything divided by itself gives me one.

138
1:5:31,560 --> 1:5:32,720
This is this property.

139
1:5:32,930 --> 1:5:37,160
This is the inverse property for the multiplication operation.

140
1:5:38,240 --> 1:5:41,690
Okay, let's use these properties to do something useful.

141
1:5:41,940 --> 1:5:45,920
Let's give a quick example, perhaps with a different color.

142
1:5:46,670 --> 1:5:47,740
Let's say what?

143
1:5:47,740 --> 1:5:56,390
That if we have... If a * b = a * c. In this case, if this statement, if this equation or expression is correct,

144
1:5:56,390 --> 2:0:0,460
logically, I should deduce that a... sorry, that b = c.

145
2:0:660 --> 2:0:1,410
Why? Let's see.

146
2:0:1,410 --> 2:0:3,910
If I said I have 2 * something = 2 * something.

147
2:0:4,430 --> 2:0:9,260
If I want this expression to be correct, then I must get the same result here equals the same result here.

148
2:0:9,260 --> 2:0:12,110
Therefore, I must put the number here, whatever.

149
2:0:12,110 --> 2:0:18,160
If I put, say, 4 here, then 2 * 4 is 8, so I must put 4 here to get 8 as the result.

150
2:0:28,10 --> 2:0:32,530
Consequently, this expression must lead to b = c. But...

151
2:0:33,530 --> 2:0:38,580
'a', which is the first number here, must not be zero.

152
2:0:38,770 --> 2:0:46,310
Why? Because if I put zero here and zero here, and I asked you, what number multiplied by zero gives me the same as that number multiplied by zero?

153
2:0:46,310 --> 2:0:47,860
Any number. You can put anything.

154
2:0:47,860 --> 2:0:52,770
If I put 2 here and 3 here, the result in the end, in both cases, will be zero.

155
2:0:53,720 --> 2:0:55,910
So, I think this part is clear.

156
2:0:56,170 --> 2:1:4,580
Now we want to prove this using the properties before us, these three properties, assuming that a ≠ 0.

157
2:1:6,200 --> 2:1:7,200
Okay, what do we want?

158
2:1:7,200 --> 2:1:10,350
We want 'b' and we want 'c'. Meaning, we want to get rid of 'a'.

159
2:1:0,350 --> 2:1:4,90
Okay, when we go back to the properties here, which property gets rid of 'a' in multiplication?

160
2:1:4,90 --> 2:1:5,550
It's the seventh property.

161
2:1:6,270 --> 2:1:7,740
Let's go back to the green color.

162
2:1:7,960 --> 2:1:32,180
So we say, in this case, we multiply by a^(-1) * a * b, bring them down as they are = a^(-1) * a . c, bring them down as they are. Okay.

163
2:1:32,830 --> 2:1:37,480
Going back to the first property of grouping, we'll put these together.

164
2:1:37,800 --> 2:1:44,920
Then we go down to the seventh property again, and say these equal one. So this becomes 1 * b = 1 * c.

165
2:1:45,830 --> 2:1:57,290
Then we go back to the sixth property, which says that one multiplied by anything gives the same thing. Therefore, from property number six, we say that b = oops = c,

166
2:1:57,710 --> 2:2:0,400
which is the assumption we started with.

167
2:2:0,770 --> 2:2:6,220
The three properties gave me the same result and they don't contradict each other.

168
2:2:6,470 --> 2:2:10,120
This means we are working in the right direction and the properties are working.

169
2:2:11,120 --> 2:2:17,970
Okay, the eighth and final property we'll work on today... or... maybe before we get into the eighth property, let's give an example... another example.

170
2:2:17,970 --> 2:2:19,490
Let's give another example.

171
2:2:22,650 --> 2:2:36,20
The example says that If a * b = 0, it means that a = 0 or b = 0. We want to prove this.

172
2:2:39,80 --> 2:2:42,140
Let's talk about this logically first.

173
2:2:42,140 --> 2:2:44,740
If I have two numbers multiplied together giving me zero, then surely one of them must be zero.

174
2:2:45,90 --> 2:2:50,170
It's possible both are zero, no problem, but at least one of them must be zero.

175
2:2:52,50 --> 2:2:57,770
By the way, this example is extremely important because quadratic equations are solved this way.

176
2:2:58,720 --> 2:3:3,810
We might see an example later about quadratic equations, but let's stick to the simple example here. Okay,

177
2:3:3,810 --> 2:3:7,380
if I want to prove that one of these two equals zero, let's assume that one of them is *not* equal to zero.

178
2:3:7,700 --> 2:3:10,790
So let's say that a ≠ 0.

179
2:3:10,980 --> 2:3:17,780
This means if I assume 'a' is not zero, then 'b' *must* be zero. Okay.

180
2:3:18,500 --> 2:3:19,570
What do I want?

181
2:3:19,570 --> 2:3:24,990
I want to find the value of 'b'. So I want to get rid of 'a' because I know 'a' is not zero, and I want to prove that 'b' is zero, so I want to find the value of 'b'.

182
2:3:25,160 --> 2:3:26,400
So let's get rid of 'a'.

183
2:3:26,650 --> 2:3:28,960
Back here again, which property got rid of 'a'?

184
2:3:28,960 --> 2:3:29,640
It's the seventh property.

185
2:3:29,870 --> 2:3:39,890
So I'll say a^(-1) * a * b = 0 * a^(-1) because I multiplied here, so I must multiply by the same number on the other side.

186
2:3:40,470 --> 2:3:42,420
By grouping, this will result in one.

187
2:3:43,150 --> 2:3:46,710
Here, anything times zero is zero.

188
2:3:47,800 --> 2:3:48,200
Okay.

189
2:3:48,410 --> 2:3:54,880
And here, this will bring down 1 * b. This looks like a 'Tah', it should be 'b'.

190
2:3:56,230 --> 2:4:9,180
And from the second property [actually, property 6], one times anything is the same thing. So this is b = 0. So I was able to prove that when 'a' was not 0, using the three properties before me, I arrived at b = 0.

191
2:4:10,570 --> 2:4:21,810
This property, as we said, is extremely important, and we use it very, very, very often, perhaps without even realizing it, in solving quadratic equations which typically have two solutions.

192
2:4:22,590 --> 2:4:26,200
Okay, there's another point we didn't clarify in the seventh property,

193
2:4:26,200 --> 2:4:27,930
the part about a ≠ 0.

194
2:4:27,930 --> 2:4:32,850
I think this should be... if you didn't catch it automatically, let's look at it quickly.

195
2:4:32,850 --> 2:4:37,610
If a is 0... if a = 0, if I try to apply this rule,

196
2:4:37,610 --> 2:4:41,840
I would have a... let's write it directly. We'd have 0...

197
2:4:42,650 --> 2:4:46,870
0 * 0^(-1).

198
2:4:7,110 --> 2:4:51,770
This means it is 0 / 0.

199
2:4:51,770 --> 2:4:55,910
Of course, division by zero is called undefined.

200
2:4:56,160 --> 2:5:2,960
You cannot perform any operation, any arithmetic operation in all of mathematics, that involves division by zero.

201
2:5:2,960 --> 2:5:6,170
Mathematics collapses when you try to divide by zero.

202
2:5:6,460 --> 2:5:12,980
So, naturally, it was necessary to put this condition here in this property for the property to work.

203
2:5:13,580 --> 2:5:15,840
The last property, the eighth property,

204
2:5:16,280 --> 2:5:22,650
I think is easy, no problem with it. Just like its counterpart in property number four exactly for addition.

205
2:5:22,650 --> 2:5:27,940
It says that a multiplied by b equals b multiplied by a.

206
2:5:28,110 --> 2:5:36,730
Meaning, like the same system, an extension of the property, or an extension of property number five. Grouping didn't matter here; here it says the order doesn't matter.

207
2:5:38,280 --> 2:5:40,660
We'll stop here, God willing, in this video.

208
2:5:41,680 --> 2:5:44,610
The next video, we will talk about property number nine,

209
2:5:44,610 --> 2:5:49,110
which is undisputedly the most important property among the 12 properties,

210
2:5:49,110 --> 2:5:58,810
and the most used property, perhaps in mathematics in general, or in dealing with numbers and arithmetic operations generally, and in algebra generally, maybe we don't feel it,

211
2:5:58,810 --> 2:5:59,710
which is distribution.

212
2:5:59,890 --> 2:6:5,680
The rule of distribution, we will see it, God willing, in the next video, and it will likely take the entire next video by itself.

213
2:6:6,470 --> 2:6:8,330
See you in the next video, God willing. Peace be upon you.
