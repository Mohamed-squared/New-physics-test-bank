00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:19,859
Hello.

2
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:31,719
In the last video, we started talking about the properties of numbers, and we discussed properties one through eight. Specifically, there were four properties for addition corresponding to four in multiplication.

3
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:41,359
Today, God willing, we will continue our discussion on the properties of numbers, and it will be about the ninth property, and only that. The entire video today, God willing, will be about the ninth property.

4
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:51,449
This is due to its importance and its high frequency of use in mathematics, arithmetic, and algebra in general, not just in calculus, as we will see in this video today, God willing.

5
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:52,679
Okay.

6
00:00:53,889 --> 00:01:11,589
What does the property itself say? The property says: If A, B, and C are any numbers, then...

7
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:28,999
A * (B + C) = A * B + A * C.

8
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:32,269
What does this mean?

9
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:45,019
We have all seen this property in one way or another during our work in past years in mathematics in general. This is the distributive property or the property or law of distribution.

10
00:01:45,839 --> 00:02:01,189
Meaning, if I have a number multiplied by a number, plus the same number multiplied by another number, I can factor out the common number and add the other two numbers inside parentheses. That is, A is multiplied by B, and A is multiplied by C, so I factor the A out and add B and C together.

11
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:10,519
The first thing that distinguishes this property is that it combines the two: addition and multiplication. I have addition here and multiplication.

12
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:25,379
The previous properties, four of them were exclusively for addition, and four of them were exclusively for multiplication. This property combines the two. And honestly, this might be the reason that gives the ninth property a somewhat special importance.

13
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,859
As we will see shortly.

14
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:35,119
Let's start with the proofs. The very first problem we had in the last video, which we said could be solved with the ninth property, was related to subtraction.

15
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:48,519
When we said that A - B = B - A, and we said that this statement is true in only one case, which is when A = B.

16
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:52,289
This property can prove this statement for me. How?

17
00:02:52,899 --> 00:03:00,119
And by the way, it wasn't possible to prove it with anything else, or with any combination of properties one through eight; they couldn't prove this simple concept for me.

18
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:04,039
Only the ninth property can prove something like this for me. Okay, so how does this work?

19
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:14,429
Let's first write down A - B = B - A.

20
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:18,109
What do we want to prove? We want to prove that A equals B.

21
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:22,359
Okay, so we want A on this side and B on this side. So we want to get rid of the B on this side first.

22
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:38,519
We get rid of it using the inverse property of addition. As we said, A... we'll write this down as it is and add positive B to them to cancel these two [-B and +B]. And of course, since we added positive B on this side, we must add it on the other side.

23
00:03:39,89 --> 00:03:45,069
This becomes zero, so A will come down as it is. I'll shorten things a bit this time; we know this from the previous properties.

24
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:54,189
And here I will use the [commutative/associative] property for arrangement by moving the B to the other side [conceptually] to group the Bs together, leaving me with negative A at the end.

25
00:03:55,59 --> 00:03:57,899
Okay, so I got A alone on the other side.

26
00:03:58,309 --> 00:04:01,129
Here I only want the Bs, and therefore, we want to get rid of the A.

27
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:11,649
Okay, how do we get rid of the A? Also using the inverse property of A. So we'll say B + B - A + A. Since I added positive A on this side, I must also add it on the other side.

28
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:18,639
These [-A and +A] will become zero, so B + B remains, and on the other side, A + A.

29
00:04:19,619 --> 00:04:28,519
It looks good, promising, but this isn't what I want. I have two A's here, I want one A. And I have two B's here, I want just one.

30
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:36,619
Okay, if we look now... until now, we haven't talked about property nine. All the work we've been doing is actually using the four properties of addition.

31
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:42,719
If we look at the ninth property now, we'll notice there's a similarity here. What is it?

32
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:49,199
The A here plus A, I have two [terms of] A on this side [A+A], and there are two [terms of] B on this side [B+B].

33
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:55,529
And I actually want to make them one A, according to... this is what I want to prove in the end.

34
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:58,689
And the other form here has one A.

35
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:02,839
The question here in this form [A*(B+C)] is, where is the B and where is the C?

36
00:05:04,39 --> 00:05:18,189
This means I want to say that this A, I will multiply it by something, plus this A, I will multiply it by something... forget the Bs, we'll get to them shortly... such that the value of A doesn't change.

37
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:24,449
What number do I multiply by A to give me A? The identity of the multiplication operation. This number will be one.

38
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:33,379
The same system will be applied to the other side. B * 1 + B * 1.

39
00:05:34,19 --> 00:05:43,189
Now I have this form. The only difference is that B and C are both equal, they equal one. But I can apply the ninth property to it. And get a single A.

40
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:50,359
So I have A here and A here, I factor them out and multiply by (1 + 1), which are the two remaining ones here.

41
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:54,529
Same system on the other side. Equals B * (1 + 1). Finished.

42
00:05:54,779 --> 00:06:04,389
This is it, this is the part. Look at this long proof, and there are still a few other steps. Only these two steps were related to the ninth property. Without them, I wouldn't have known how to continue.

43
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:11,389
Okay. A * 2... one and one equals 2... equals B * 2.

44
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:24,849
How do I get rid of the two? Normal stuff now, which is the inverse property. The inverse property of the multiplication operation, which is [A *] 2 * 2⁻¹ = B * 2 * 2⁻¹. All of this [2 * 2⁻¹] is one.

45
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:32,659
So A * 1 = B * 1. The identity of the multiplication operation again. So A = B.

46
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,329
Which is what was required to be proven (Q.E.D.).

47
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,109
That was the first example we had.

48
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:50,169
The second example that we can use, or use the ninth property in its proof, is something we used a lot in the previous videos, in the last video, but we didn't prove it.

49
00:06:50,549 --> 00:06:53,339
This rule says that A * 0 = 0.

50
00:06:53,649 --> 00:07:00,999
We used this statement more than once, but we sort of turned a blind eye to its proof until we prove it here.

51
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:03,469
How do we prove this rule using the ninth property?

52
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:08,049
Let's look at A * 0.

53
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:14,279
And let's also add to it, plus A * 0.

54
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:17,899
This statement resembles that statement.

55
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:28,049
So I have A and A, I'll factor it out and leave the zero and zero to be added together. So A * (0 + 0).

56
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:34,179
0 + 0 = 0. So A * 0.

57
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:41,479
This comes down as it is. A * 0 + A * 0.

58
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:49,369
Okay, what do I want to prove? I want A * 0 on this side here. And I have A * 0 + A * 0 here.

59
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:56,569
So let's get rid of this A * 0 on this side. And these are added together, so I use the inverse property of the addition operation, which is to add the negative of this number. So...

60
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:04,259
A * 0 + A * 0 - (A * 0) to get rid of one of them.

61
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:12,659
Equals A * 0, which is this one... So, [subtract] -(A * 0) [from both sides].

62
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:19,189
These will cancel each other out, leaving me with A * 0 on this side.

63
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:30,189
Equals... what's this? A * 0 - (A * 0). A number minus the same number equals zero.

64
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:39,759
This is the inverse property, I don't need to do anything else with it. So here too, I was able... this was a quick and simple proof. A * 0 = 0... the [expression involving] A * 0 I started with [equals zero].

65
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,929
Okay.

66
00:08:42,629 --> 00:09:02,589
The ninth property has another very important use, which talks about a famous rule we've all used a lot. Umm... Let's first clean the board and work on this rule cleanly. Perhaps this is the most important rule we will prove using the ninth property.

67
00:09:03,39 --> 00:09:04,019
See you in a minute.

68
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:07,639
Okay.

69
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:20,129
The important rule we want to prove with the ninth property, which states or determines the relationship of the sign in the multiplication operation. Meaning...

70
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:28,489
...that we have a rule saying that negative times positive gives me negative, and negative times negative gives me positive.

71
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:30,349
Let's prove the first one first.

72
00:09:30,729 --> 00:09:42,609
The first one says -A * B = the whole result is A multiplied by B, all together like that, negative [-(A*B)].

73
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:55,429
Meaning, if I have a negative number multiplied by a positive number, the result of this is the product of A and B, and the whole sign, or the entire sign altogether, becomes negative.

74
00:09:55,749 --> 00:09:57,479
We want to prove this statement. Okay.

75
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:02,069
Let's start with the part on this side [-A * B].

76
00:10:02,989 --> 00:10:05,789
We have -A * B.

77
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:10,439
Let's add A * B to them.

78
00:10:11,849 --> 00:10:17,599
There's B here and B here. Using the ninth property, we can factor it out. So we'll say this equals...

79
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:28,219
...put big parentheses here, put inside them -A + A, and the B that we factored outside.

80
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,999
Of course, I can put it here... it's placed on this side, I can put it on the other side, it won't make a difference.

81
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:45,249
-A multiplied by... Aaah sorry, this is positive! This is the plus. -A + A, that's the inverse property, so this became zero.

82
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:50,659
So all of this became 0 * B.

83
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:56,769
Okay, I just now proved that anything times zero gives me zero. So this side is finished, it's zero.

84
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:04,289
And on this side, I have... bring this down as it is: -A * B + A * B.

85
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:09,969
Okay, what did I start with? With -A * B, which is this one. Okay, I want to get rid of this one [A*B]? The inverse property.

86
00:11:10,729 --> 00:11:31,709
-A * B + A * B... let's put them in parentheses because we will subtract shortly after... we will subtract here... so [we subtract A*B from both sides]... equals 0... minus... we will subtract A * B.

87
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:41,989
Okay, this [A*B - A*B] will go, all this part will go, it will be zero, and this zero will also [not] go [0 - (A*B)].

88
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:51,489
So we are left with -A * B = -(A * B).

89
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:52,429
The same start.

90
00:11:52,919 --> 00:12:02,319
So, a negative number multiplied by a positive number gives me the product of the two numbers A * B, and the sign altogether at the end is negative.

91
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:10,239
This is great. So we have thus proven this part or this rule using the ninth property.

92
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:14,269
Now we want to prove that negative times negative gives us positive.

93
00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:18,129
Let's remove what's on the board and prove this part now.

94
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:30,179
Okay, a short while ago we proved that -A * (+B) = -(A * B).

95
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:33,839
Negative times positive equals negative.

96
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:45,179
This proof itself, along with property nine, I will use it in the second part now that I want to prove, which says that negative...

97
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:53,619
...times negative equals positive.

98
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:57,169
Okay, how will we prove this statement?

99
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:12,049
Let's work on the part on the left side, (-A)*(-B), and continue with it and see in the end what the result will be. If it gives me positive A * B or A times B, then great, and the proof is working correctly.

100
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:15,229
Okay, so all our work will be on this side.

101
00:13:16,469 --> 00:13:19,759
Okay, -A * -B.

102
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:31,219
Let's add this to it... -(A * B).

103
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:37,809
-(A * B) equals this [-A * B].

104
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:53,479
So let's bring down the equation as it is. -A * -B plus... this [-(A*B)] we will expand to this [-A * B], so it becomes -A * B.

105
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:58,309
This form is the same as this form in property nine.

106
00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:02,089
I have -A multiplied by a number and -A multiplied by a number.

107
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:12,819
Let's factor -A out. So -A * (-B + B).

108
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:24,449
This is the inverse property of addition. So it's zero. So we have -A * 0. And this statement also equals 0.

109
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:32,419
-A multiplied by anything, or zero multiplied by anything, gives me zero in the end. We just proved this rule a short while ago.

110
00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:39,179
Okay, and this statement, of course, the zero equals this same statement we started with, but you know, so we don't keep writing it every time.

111
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,889
Okay, I want to go back to what I started with. I added -(A * B) here. So let me remove it.

112
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:52,999
And in the end, what do I have here? Zero on the other side. How do I remove it? With the inverse property.

113
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:55,409
So we will add its positive counterpart to it.

114
00:14:55,739 --> 00:15:19,459
So in the end, the equation comes out like this: (-A * -B) + (-A * B) + the positive of this number [A*B] to get rid of [-A*B]... So A * B... equals 0 + A * B.

115
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:29,449
Zero plus anything, this is the identity of addition. So it will come down as it is, A * B.

116
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:48,389
And these, we removed them [-A*B + A*B]. This is also the inverse identity of addition. Negative number plus the same number. So all this will go and become zero. So in the end, I am left with -A * -B or times -B. This is it exactly.

117
00:15:48,669 --> 00:15:55,289
The equation I started with. -A * -B gives me positive A B.

118
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:58,999
So I was able to prove that negative times negative equals positive.

119
00:15:59,529 --> 01:00:02,049
A rule of utmost importance. And this is the benefit...

120
01:00:02,449 --> 01:00:12,089
...of our study of the properties of numbers, because through this, we can find mathematical reasoning and we can find how to connect these rules together.

121
01:00:12,439 --> 01:00:20,199
Because it didn't just come arbitrarily, meaning the mathematics folks didn't sit around and... make things up like that, finding that negative times negative looks nice when it's positive? No.

122
01:00:20,779 --> 01:00:28,099
It is linked to properties that determine what can be done with numbers and what cannot be done with numbers.

123
01:00:29,169 --> 01:00:32,489
The next example, then, is an example of utmost importance, talking about the quadratic equation.

124
01:00:32,739 --> 01:00:39,339
We have all worked with the quadratic equation and know what its forms look like and what its graph looks like.

125
01:00:39,879 --> 01:00:53,429
The quadratic equation in the end, the method or the two forms of them that we use, which is the factorization we perform on it, is ultimately nothing more than a manifestation of the ninth property, as we will see right now.

126
01:00:55,19 --> 01:00:59,519
If we look at the equation that says (x - 1) * (x - 2) = 0.

127
01:01:10,509 --> 01:01:21,759
This equation is exactly the same as x² - x [error, should be -3x] + 2 = 0. These two are equal to each other.

128
01:01:22,699 --> 01:01:32,629
The question here is, how does the factorization of this quadratic equation happen? As we said, this results from or is done through the use of the ninth property.

129
01:01:32,899 --> 01:01:35,199
How is this done? Let's start with the form above.

130
01:01:38,949 --> 01:01:47,499
Let's say (x - 1)(x - 2) = ...

131
01:01:50,449 --> 01:01:51,929
This is a bit tricky.

132
01:01:52,469 --> 01:01:58,199
We will assume that this [(x-1)] is this [A in A*(B+C)].

133
01:01:58,549 --> 01:02:04,179
And the (x - 2) is the (B + C).

134
01:02:04,479 --> 01:02:11,249
So this, I consider (x - 1)... sorry, the (x - 2) is what I will consider A.

135
01:02:11,509 --> 01:02:17,509
And the (x - 1) I will consider it the B + C. And of course, the reverse is also true, but this is the example we will work on.

136
01:02:17,829 --> 01:02:26,609
Therefore, to get... so this is in the factored form, to get the expanded form, I will take the (x - 1) and multiply it by the (x - 2) [term by term distribution/FOIL], and so on.

137
01:02:26,829 --> 01:02:42,609
Okay, so I will have here x multiplied by (x - 2) plus -1 multiplied by (x - 2).

138
01:02:44,439 --> 01:02:57,209
Okay, let's finish this calculation inside. x * x... + (-2) * x... + (-1) * x...

139
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:10,939
...plus (-1) * -2.

140
01:03:11,589 --> 01:03:14,719
I multiplied the x by this whole parenthesis and multiplied the -1 by this whole parenthesis.

141
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:20,329
That's it, you then combine them together. Here x * x, that's x².

142
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:27,639
Plus... this is in this form [-2x + -1x], we want to put it in this form [combine terms using reverse distribution].

143
01:03:28,209 --> 01:03:43,899
So we'll factor the x out. So you have x, this is now multiplied by (-2 + -1).

144
01:03:44,989 --> 01:03:50,679
Plus -1 multiplied by -2.

145
01:03:52,369 --> 01:03:54,109
Okay, x².

146
01:03:54,769 --> 01:04:05,719
Plus -2 + -1 = -3. So all of this will be -3 multiplied by x.

147
01:04:06,419 --> 01:04:14,509
Plus negative times negative, we just said a little while ago that it's positive. So 1 * 2 will be 2. So all of this will remain 2 as it is.

148
01:04:14,949 --> 01:04:24,159
That's it, this is the equation above, but if we wanted to adjust it, it would be x² - 3x + 2.

149
01:04:24,859 --> 01:04:34,939
So we proved that the factorization part that is done, whether it's switching between the two forms in the quadratic equation or its factorization form, is ultimately a manifestation of the ninth property.

150
01:04:35,499 --> 01:04:43,199
Not only that. There's another example now, which I will conclude the video with, perhaps you'll find it maybe... maybe you'll feel it's a bit surprising, but it's a logical matter.

151
01:04:44,79 --> 01:04:48,489
The arithmetic operation itself, as we will see in a moment.

152
01:04:50,589 --> 01:04:51,279
Okay.

153
01:04:51,699 --> 01:05:00,339
The ninth property intervenes in a simple operation like this, like this normal multiplication operation.

154
01:05:00,739 --> 01:05:03,319
13 * 24, this gives you...

155
01:05:03,989 --> 01:05:13,099
52... 26... and 312. This is the final result.

156
01:05:15,939 --> 01:05:21,569
This calculation, the algorithm we worked with here, is derived from the ninth property. How?

157
01:05:21,939 --> 01:05:25,969
Let's put this calculation in our usual form.

158
01:05:26,609 --> 01:05:35,079
13 here... times... what is this 24 actually? 24 is 20 + 4.

159
01:05:37,239 --> 01:05:47,979
If you multiply 13 by 20, and then multiply 13 by 4, and add them together, it will give you the final number, which is 312.

160
01:05:48,439 --> 01:05:51,989
Of course, I'm not going to sit and do this arithmetic operation, I'll leave it for you to do, I won't waste time on it.

161
01:05:52,359 --> 01:06:05,509
But not just that. You can expand this 20, meaning you can say equals 13 multiplied by... what is this 20 actually? 20 is 10 * 2 + 4.

162
01:06:07,379 --> 01:06:27,499
And then you take the 13, you say... multiplying all this, you say 13 * 10 * 2 plus the 13... you will distribute now to the other side, the 13 times 4. So this... so these are like this, just for clarification.

163
01:06:28,29 --> 01:06:38,819
Okay? And finish it like this, you say for example that... no, sorry, 13 * 4 to do this. This is 'times', not 'plus'.

164
01:06:39,589 --> 01:06:47,899
This is easy, you can say what... 13 * 10 is 130, * 2 is 260, right? 260, something like that.

165
01:06:48,379 --> 01:07:07,929
Okay? And this 13, afterwards, you can expand it again, meaning you could, to expand 13 * 4 to get the 52 we got, you'd say that 13 is 10 + 3 multiplied by 4, and then multiply the 4 by 10 and then multiply it by 3, and so on.

166
01:07:08,309 --> 01:07:19,209
So in the end, the algorithm of this multiplication operation, of course I won't waste time on it sitting expanding them and multiplying them, if you want to check this matter, sit and work on it. This [13*4 part] in the end will reach 52 with you.

167
01:07:19,659 --> 01:07:31,669
What's the summary? That the algorithm we use in arithmetic in an operation like multiplication is also derived from the very important property, which is the ninth property.

168
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:39,959
The next video, God willing, will be the last video in the first chapter, which talks about the properties of numbers.

169
01:07:40,429 --> 01:07:45,849
We will continue our talk in it about properties 10, 11, and 12. Easy, God willing, no problems in them.

170
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:58,159
And after that, we'll lay out all the properties together and sit and look at them one last look, and, you know, see what we learned... what we learned from them before we move on to the next chapter, God willing.

171
01:07:58,579 --> 01:08:00,459
See you in the next video. Peace be upon you.
