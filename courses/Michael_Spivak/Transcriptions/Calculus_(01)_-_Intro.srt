00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,740
Peace be upon you

2
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,740
This video will be a preview of the topic we will talk about in the next course

3
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,740
Which is

4
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,740
Calculus

5
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,740
We know calculus as

6
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,740
Differentiation and

7
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,740
Integration

8
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,740
Integration

9
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,740
How did 'differentiation and integration' 

10
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,740
end up being called something like 'calculus'?

11
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,740
Let's clear up this naming confusion first

12
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,740
and then we'll continue our discussion.

13
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,740
Calculus is two main parts

14
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,740
One is called

15
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,740
Differential

16
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,740
Differential

17
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,740
Calculus

18
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,740
The other is

19
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,740
Integral

20
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,740
Integral

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,740
Calculus

22
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,740
In brief, both of them are called calculus

23
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,740
Differentiation or differential Calculus 

24
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,740
And integration or integral calculus

25
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,740
And integration or integral calculus

26
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,740
And integration or integral calculus

27
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,740
Before we leave this part

28
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:33,740
I want to say something else, there are many people who think that you have to learn differentiation first to learn integration

29
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:39,740
and that integration is based on differentiation, and this is not true at all

30
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:46,740
you can learn integration before differentiation, both are considered to be the same subject

31
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,740
and in a certain example they are considered opposite to each other

32
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,740
but it is not a condition to learn this first and then this

33
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,740
and in most of the courses, including the one we will be working on today

34
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,740
we will be working on differentiation and then integration, but this is not a condition

35
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:11,740
in fact, one of the two who wrote the calculus published the integration first before differentiation

36
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:17,740
and I think that 100-200 years after the creation of the calculus, most books talked about both separately

37
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,740
they wrote the integration and then the differentiation, there was no problem at all

38
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,740
I just wanted to clarify this part initially

39
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,740
ok

40
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,740
so what does calculus mean?

41
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:36,740
there are many people who enter a course like this and then they draw a graph and say that calculus is the rate of change

42
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,740
and that it is the slope of the tangent line of a point on a curve

43
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,740
and that integration is the area below the curve or part of the curve

44
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:49,740
and if they want to go deeper into the subject, they will give you the example of velocity

45
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,740
and the change of distance over time

46
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,740
and acceleration which is the change of velocity over time

47
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,740
and so on

48
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,740
I think that this is a bit early

49
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,740
I mean, we can't get into this in a stage like this

50
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:08,740
if we were to give an example that is more in depth and simpler to understand

51
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,740
so that we know what calculus is about

52
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:18,740
and frankly, the example of calculating the calculus in the framework that I just mentioned

53
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,740
I think it is not very accurate

54
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,740
because these are tools

55
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,740
that calculus has

56
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,740
but the problem that calculus deals with is what I need to talk about a little

57
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,740
ok

58
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:41,740
I will say one sentence about calculus before moving on to the historical part that explains the circumstances of the creation of calculus

59
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:50,740
if I wanted to give a definition of calculus, I can say that I personally call it the art of dealing with narrow spaces

60
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,740
ok

61
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,740
so, keep this sentence in your mind

62
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,740
now, it will be clear after a while

63
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,740
when we mention the word calculus

64
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,740
there are two names that appear instantly

65
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,740
Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz

66
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,740
Isaac Newton is the most famous mathematician in the world

67
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,740
he is an English scientist

68
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:16,740
he is the king of gravity for at least 200 years

69
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,740
Newton's laws

70
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,740
he has achievements in optics and other things like that

71
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,740
and he invented calculus

72
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,740
Leibniz is less famous than him

73
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,740
although he is also a very respected scientist

74
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,740
he is a German scientist

75
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,740
he studied law in Germany

76
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,740
then he moved to France

77
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,740
he studied mathematics

78
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,740
he liked it a little

79
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,740
he continued with it

80
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,740
and then he invented calculus

81
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,740
he did not invent calculus only

82
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,740
he had achievements in other things

83
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,740
including the invention of the binary system of zero and one

84
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,740
which we are using today in computer systems

85
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,740
this was in the second half of the 17th century

86
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:59,740
the question here is what makes two scientists invent calculus at the same time

87
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,740
of course, when Leibniz and Newton started to spread their words about calculus

88
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,740
Europe, literally, before calculus

89
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,740
or before Leibniz and Newton started to talk about their achievements in calculus

90
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,740
was something

91
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,740
and after calculus was something else

92
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,740
I personally am convinced that

93
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,740
 the real European rise started with calculus

94
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,740
calculus without exaggeration

95
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,740
is the foundation of modern science

96
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,740
which you see around you today

97
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,740
without calculus you really go back to technology

98
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,740
until the beginning of the 18th century

99
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,740
so calculus is an important subject

100
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,740
you have to study it in depth

101
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,740
because any career you want to persue: Physics, Engineering

102
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,740
or any kind of science

103
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,740
even if it has advanced things in mathematics

104
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,740
calculus is the thing that takes all of that

105
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,740
okay

106
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,740
something of importance

107
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,740
when someone like Newton or Leibniz says

108
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,740
we invented calculus

109
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,740
Europe and its scientific community

110
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,740
stood on their feet

111
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,740
and there was a big fight between the two

112
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,740
which of them had the right to claim that they invented calculus

113
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,740
Newton says I did it

114
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,740
Leibniz says I did it

115
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,740
and a debate occurred between the two of them

116
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,740
and there was a huge debate in the scientific community in Europe

117
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,740
for decades

118
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,740
even after the death of Leibniz and Newton

119
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,740
to say who really invented calculus

120
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:35,740
and historians settled that Newton and Leibniz invented calculus independently

121
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,740
and of course there were many evidences of this

122
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,740
one of them was the difference in timing

123
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,740
and the notes they wrote

124
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,740
and the most important difference

125
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,740
or the most important point that supported

126
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,740
the idea that the two of them did it separately

127
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,740
is that the two

128
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,740
although they reached the same result at the end in calculus

129
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,740
but the approach of each one of them was completely different

130
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,740
Newton and Leibniz looked at calculus from two completely different perspectives

131
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,740
and this is an important point you should keep in mind

132
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,740
because sometimes when we talk about calculus

133
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,740
we look at it from this perspective

134
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,740
which is the rate of change

135
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,740
of course the rate of change is the most important thing

136
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,740
and we take it only in physics

137
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,740
and it adjusts the velocity and acceleration

138
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,740
and the end of the subject

139
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,740
calculus is very important

140
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,740
you will be surprised that it is used strongly in finance and economics

141
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,740
so calculus is much wider than this perspective

142
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,740
which we sometimes gather ourselves in

143
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,740
let's go back to the most important question

144
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,740
what makes someone like Newton

145
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,740
someone like Leibniz

146
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,740
living in two different countries

147
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,740
think about something important

148
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,740
like calculus

149
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,740
and almost at the same time

150
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,740
calculus was not a luxury

151
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,740
meaning that Newton and Leibniz were not sitting idle

152
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,740
and they said let's make something new

153
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,740
so they made calculus

154
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,740
no

155
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,740
and this is a very important point

156
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,740
you should keep in mind

157
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,740
calculus was a cure for a problem already existing

158
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,740
and this problem reached a stage

159
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,740
that science, especially physics

160
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,739
became a burden that cannot move

161
00:08:14,743 --> 00:08:18,739
and this problem existed for thousands of years

162
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,740
to understand this problem

163
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,740
let's go back to the example I mentioned

164
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,740
which is a fundamental one

165
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,740
in explaining what is the problem of calculus

166
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,740
this example is from the days of the Greeks

167
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,740
specifically Archimedes

168
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,740
you know that the Greeks were fascinated by geometry

169
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,740
geometry was not part of mathematics

170
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,740
but this was their life in geometry

171
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,740
so Archimedes was trying to calculate an example

172
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,740
to calculate the area of the circle

173
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,740
of course when I say that Archimedes was trying to calculate the area of the circle

174
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,740
I am very simplifying what Archimedes was doing

175
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,740
Archimedes was trying to find the nearest value of pi

176
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,740
to calculate the area of the circle and its circumference

177
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,740
but for simplicity we will say that he wanted to calculate the area of the circle

178
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,740
and for simplicity we will not take the approach that they all did

179
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,740
because his approach is big

180
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,740
and there are many details

181
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,740
we will just take a specific part from it

182
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,740
to take me to the problem that preceded him

183
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,740
and after that Newton and Leibniz solved it

184
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,740
and they solved it with calculus

185
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,740
to make this clear

186
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,740
let's go to the computer

187
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,740
and see the model in GeoGebra

188
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,740
how it looks

189
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,740
and try to solve the problem

190
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:34,740
or try to represent what Archimedes did

191
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,740
about 200 years before the birth

192
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,740
this is the circle we will work on

193
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,740
and we want to see what Archimedes did

194
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,740
to calculate its area

195
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:54,740
Archimedes did not have a way to calculate the area of the circle

196
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,740
because it is a curve

197
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,740
they could calculate the area and circumference of shapes

198
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,740
made up of straight lines

199
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,740
like triangles, squares, rectangles, polygons, etc.

200
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,740
so he said let's put a shape of these straight shapes

201
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,740
that we can calculate its area

202
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,740
and put it inside the circle so that it occupies the largest space of the circle

203
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,740
and thus it is almost the area of the circle

204
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,740
so he put a hexagon

205
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,740
or a polygon of 6 sides

206
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,740
why did he start with a hexagon?

207
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,740
because the hexagon has a very important symmetry

208
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,740
each of the rectangles in front of you

209
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,740
from the hexagon

210
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,740
equals half the diameter of the circle

211
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,740
that surrounds it from the 6 angles

212
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,740
this is something that distinguishes the hexagon

213
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,740
that's why he started from the hexagon

214
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,740
because it provides him with very important information

215
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,740
that facilitates the proof that he was working with

216
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,740
as we said there are many details in the work of Archimedes

217
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,740
in the pie group or the circumference group

218
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,740
or in the area of the circle

219
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,740
we will not talk about it

220
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,740
I just care about a specific part

221
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,740
in clarifying the problem that the calculus is trying to solve

222
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,740
if we look at this hexagon

223
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,740
it occupies a space that is not necessarily of the circle

224
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,740
we have some simple things here

225
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,740
which are the white parts

226
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,740
we can

227
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,740
increase the accuracy of the area

228
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,740
if we increase the number of rectangles of the polygon

229
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,740
so we started with 6

230
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,740
and now we have another polygon

231
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,740
let's make it of 12 sides

232
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,740
and here we want to look at something

233
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,740
the first side

234
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,740
or the hexagon

235
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,740
when it was 6 sides

236
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,740
is longer than each side in the polygon

237
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,740
when it was 12 sides

238
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,740
ok

239
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,740
the distance between the two vertices

240
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,740
as a result of the polygon's radius being short

241
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,740
the distance between the two vertices got smaller

242
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,740
instead of the distance between the two vertices

243
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,740
as you can see

244
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,740
the distance between the two vertices is less than ti

245
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,740
approximately the half

246
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,740
or more precisely

247
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,740
half

248
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,740
keep in mind

249
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,740
that we will go back to this part later

250
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,740
I still have a white part

251
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,740
it is true that my accuracy of the area has increased

252
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,740
but I still have a white part here

253
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,740
I didn't cover it up

254
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,740
I didn't cover it up

255
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,740
ok

256
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,740
if I increased the number of rectangles of the polygon

257
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,740
I started with 6

258
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,740
now it is 12

259
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,740
let's make it 24

260
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,740
now it is clear that we have almost finished the whole circle

261
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,740
but I said almost

262
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,740
why?

263
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,740
because even though you may not be able to keep track of it

264
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,740
there are still white parts

265
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,740
and to see these white parts

266
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,740
if we zoom in

267
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,740
it can be more clear

268
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:47,740
you will notice that the white distance here has increased

269
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,740
not only increased

270
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,740
you will notice that these two points

271
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,740
after they were very close to each other

272
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,740
they got apart

273
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,740
and this is a very important point

274
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,740
after I zoomed in

275
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,740
the distance between the two points increased

276
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,740
and I was able to show you that this white part is present

277
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,740
no, there is a part of the circle

278
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,740
we still haven't been able to calculate its area

279
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,740
ok

280
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,740
if we increase it again

281
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,740
we have increased the number of the polygon

282
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,740
and we made it 48

283
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,740
ah, no

284
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,740
we have almost finished the whole circle

285
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,740
but if you focus a little here

286
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,740
you will find that there is still a white space here

287
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,740
and if we zoom in more

288
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,740
you will notice that every time I zoom in

289
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,740
these two points are far apart

290
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,740
I stretch them

291
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,740
and the white space here appears in front of me

292
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,740
and this is something

293
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,740
that is very important

294
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,740
ok

295
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,740
let's see what we did

296
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,740
first we put the hexagon

297
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,740
which is 6

298
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,740
6 sides

299
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,740
then we made them 12 sides

300
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,740
we covered a larger area

301
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,740
then we made 48 sides

302
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,740
we covered a larger area

303
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,740
then we made

304
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,740
no, it was 6, 12, 24

305
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,740
then 48

306
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,740
in conclusion, it is clear here

307
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,740
that no matter how much we increase the number of sides of the polygon

308
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,740
there will always be a part of the circle

309
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,740
that we still haven't been able to cover with the area

310
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,740
because we are still looking for a space

311
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,740
because any two points

312
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,740
no matter how close they are to each other

313
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,740
I can zoom in on them

314
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,740
and show you that there is a large space between them

315
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,740
we will talk about this topic in detail later

316
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,740
the question here is when

317
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,740
the length of this polygon

318
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,740
or the width of this polygon

319
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,740
covers the circle

320
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,740
without a gap

321
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,740
without this white space

322
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,740
the answer is when this point sticks to this point

323
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:43,740
so that the length of the polygon's radius is the same as the point

324
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,740
it is just a point on the circle

325
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,740
the problem is that this is mathematically impossible

326
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,740
why?

327
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,740
let's go to the board and see

328
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,740
I think we understood what Archimedes was trying to do

329
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,740
and we understood that his problem is that no matter how much the number of sides is increased

330
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,740
he will always have a side

331
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,740
that leaves a space

332
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,414
between him and the circle

333
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,740
because the circle is curved

334
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,740
and the polygon is a straight line

335
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,740
and we said that it is impossible

336
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,740
for this polygon to stick to the circle

337
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,740
and remove all the space to calculate it

338
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,740
other than when this point sticks to this point

339
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,740
the problem is that in order for this to happen

340
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,740
we must understand how the real numbers work

341
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,740
because here there is a contradiction

342
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,740
if we look at it

343
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,740
let's talk about the natural numbers

344
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,740
let's say here is 0

345
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,740
and here is 1

346
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,740
and here is 2

347
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,740
and here is 3

348
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,740
and here we are talking about natural numbers

349
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,740
if I told you

350
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,740
what are the numbers between 1 and 3

351
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,740
how many will you tell me?

352
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,740
you will tell me 2

353
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,740
and your answer will be 100% correct

354
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,740
why?

355
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,740
because the natural numbers have only the whole numbers

356
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,740
the positive ones

357
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,740
in this situation we are not dealing with natural numbers

358
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,740
we are dealing with the set of natural numbers

359
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,740
a set of real numbers

360
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
and the set of real numbers is different from the set of natural numbers

361
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:18,739
because if I told you what in the set of real numbers is between 1 and 3

362
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,740
you will tell me 2

363
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,740
1.5

364
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,740
2.5

365
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,740
2.3

366
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,740
2.999999999

367
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,740
it's infinity

368
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,740
the number of numbers between 1 and 3

369
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,740
infinity

370
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,740
the number of numbers between 1 and 2

371
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,740
infinity

372
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,740
the number of numbers between any 2 numbers

373
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:43,140
No matter how small the distance between them is on the real numbers line, it's infinity.

374
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:48,540
Any two points you can put, I can zoom in on them, as I did in the program a while ago,

375
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:54,040
and I can get an infinite number of numbers between them, no matter how small the distance between them is.

376
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,740
The same problem here.

377
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:06,140
To connect this point to this point, so that this line is the distance between two points on the circle,

378
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:12,340
and these two points don't have anything between them, that's impossible, because there are no points between real numbers.

379
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:16,340
And this was the problem.  That is the calculus.

380
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:23,940
Archimedes imagined something, and gave it a name for a while, not the name we will use later,

381
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:29,940
but he imagined that there is a number, small, but not zero.

382
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,940
We will return to this concept later, but keep this in mind.

383
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,940
This problem was,

384
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,340
it existed for a long time, as we said, Archimedes, and it remained with the scientists for a long time.

385
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:47,340
When did we get a serious work to solve this problem?

386
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,340
This was in the first half of the 17th century.

387
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:57,840
You have scientists like Kepler, Descartes, Fermat, Pascal, all of them tried to solve this problem.

388
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,740
They were trying to solve the problem that we talked about at the beginning of the video,

389
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,740
which is the second problem.

390
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,940
The second problem is the tangent line between the point on the curve and the area below the curve.

391
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,940
This problem is this problem.

392
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,940
How? We will see this in the course.

393
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,940
Specifically, this problem, or solving this problem,

394
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,940
it would be easy if I could act in this problem,

395
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:29,940
because the only constraint in getting this tangent line and the area below the curve,

396
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,940
is to reach the point, or the distance between the two points,

397
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,940
so that there is nothing between them.

398
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,940
And the number of points is not allowed.

399
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,940
As we said, there are many scientists who tried this problem,

400
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,940
and some of their techniques worked.

401
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,940
Their problem was that they were isolated,

402
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,940
meaning that this technique works in this graph, but it does not work in another graph,

403
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,940
or it works in this type of problem, but it does not work in other problems,

404
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,940
or it makes errors in this case, and in the other case, it does not make errors.

405
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,940
So, the problem was not consistent, and it was not possible to solve it,

406
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,940
and it was not something that worked on all the graphs.

407
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,940
And here is the achievement of Newton and Leibniz.

408
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,940
Newton and Leibniz studied the experiments they did,

409
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,940
which they did with very high accuracy and very focused,

410
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,940
and they benefited from all the errors they made,

411
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,940
and they collected all this and came up with the technique called calculus,

412
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,940
specifically integration and differentiation.

413
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,940
Their problem was that their foundation was not strong.

414
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,940
The tool that was working, really, made a revolution in the scientific community,

415
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:37,940
in Europe, because without it, physics was stuck,

416
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,940
because all the modern problems of physics depend on the rate of change,

417
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,940
depend on irregular shapes,

418
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:52,940
traditional mathematics such as arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry

419
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,940
could not solve the real problems in the real world.

420
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,940
So, physics was really stuck in this stage.

421
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,940
So, calculus was the solution,

422
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,940
and that is why I always say that if Newton and Leibniz had not invented it,

423
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,940
someone else would have invented it.

424
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,940
One of these scientists who worked on these things would have reached a solution in the end,

425
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:18,940
because physics would not have moved forward if calculus had not appeared.

426
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:24,940
As we said, Newton and Leibniz made the technique,

427
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,940
but the foundation that this technique had in terms of mathematical fundamentals

428
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,940
and mathematical reasoning was very, very weak,

429
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,940
because they could not find a solution.

430
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,940
So, they came up with a new idea,

431
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,940
and it was Leibniz,

432
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,940
he made a shortcut,

433
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,940
he said,

434
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,940
we cannot solve this problem,

435
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,940
so we invented a new term,

436
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,940
they took the same idea from Archimedes,

437
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,940
but they gave it a very funny name,

438
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,940
it is called

439
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:59,940
infinitesimal numbers,

440
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,940
or quantities.

441
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,940
What does it mean?

442
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:08,940
This group says that there is a very, very small number,

443
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,940
smaller than anything you can imagine,

444
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,940
and smaller than anything you can measure,

445
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,940
but it is larger than zero,

446
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,940
it is still in the positive numbers.

447
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,940
What is this number? We do not know.

448
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,940
It exists.

449
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:28,940
And this was the problem in the calculus of Newton and Leibniz.

450
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,940
Of course, all mathematics scholars and all philosophers

451
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,940
who were present at that time

452
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,940
criticized this concept,

453
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,940
because there is nothing to be said about it,

454
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,940
there is nothing,

455
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,940
you cannot hold something in your hand,

456
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,940
you cannot put an important branch in mathematics

457
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,940
on a strange concept like this.

458
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,940
But calculus was working,

459
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,940
you come to hold the equation of calculus,

460
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,940
and apply it, and it is full working,

461
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,940
but the foundation had a big problem.

462
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,940
It had a big problem to the extent that there was a very famous person called Berkeley,

463
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,940
who wrote an article after Newton and Leibniz died,

464
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,940
 by about 10 or 20, maybe 30 years,

465
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,940
in which the foundation of calculus was criticized very heavily.

466
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,940
Maybe this is one of the most critical points

467
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,940
that the foundation of calculus had to deal with.

468
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,940
And he described these infinitesimal numbers,

469
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:18,940
and he called them the ghosts of the departed quantities.

470
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,940
Finally, I want to say that Newton and Leibniz

471
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,940
are talking about a number that died,

472
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,940
and we are now dealing with its absence,

473
00:22:25,943 --> 00:22:29,939
or I mean, it is exactly what he meant,

474
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,940
of course, there was a big problem in this subject.

475
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,940
This problem was solved later.

476
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,940
We will come to this subject in a little while.

477
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,940
In the late 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century,

478
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,940
or in the first half of the 18th century,

479
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,940
a group of scientists appeared

480
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,940
who contributed to the development of calculus

481
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,940
and the development of mathematics in general,

482
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,940
but I only care about three of them here.

483
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,940
Taylor, Euler, and Fourier.

484
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,940
These three had contributions to mathematics in general,

485
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,940
but they were three common factors

486
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,940
that taught a lot in two parts,

487
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,940
which are the sequences

488
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,940
and the series.

489
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,940
Of course, the sequences and the series

490
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,940
are not new concepts,

491
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,940
they did not appear in the 17th and 18th centuries,

492
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,940
but they were from the days of Fonacci,

493
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,940
before that, for example, 300 or 400 years ago.

494
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,940
So, these are old concepts,

495
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,940
but with the advent of calculus,

496
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,940
they started to look at sequences and series in a different way,

497
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,940
and they started to talk about them in a deeper way

498
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,940
in the infinite series.

499
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,940
This led to the emergence of another concept,

500
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,940
which we will talk about later,

501
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,940
which corrected the infinitesimal numbers.

502
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,940
And here comes the role of the next scientist,

503
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,940
who is called Cauchy,

504
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,940
and this was a French scientist.

505
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,940
He was in the late 18th century

506
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,940
and in the beginning of the century,

507
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,940
or in the first half of the 19th century.

508
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,940
Cauchy was the first to present a concept,

509
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,940
let's put it here,

510
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,940
because this is its place,

511
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,940
the concept of limits,

512
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,940
and we put this in a square.

513
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,940
Limits are the foundation

514
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,940
on which calculus is drawn.

515
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,940
Limits are the concept

516
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,940
that replaced the infinitesimal numbers.

517
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,940
And limits were formed

518
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,940
after a great development in mathematics,

519
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,940
and one of the most important things

520
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,940
that led Cauchy to be able to understand the concept of limits

521
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,940
and present it,

522
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,940
is the sequence of the series.

523
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,940
That's why I mentioned it,

524
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,940
one of the most important things in calculus,

525
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,940
because it has a very strong impact on the limit.

526
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,940
Cauchy was the first to present,

527
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,940
or to talk about the limit,

528
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,940
more than 130 years after the calculus

529
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,940
that Newton and Leibniz did.

530
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,940
To the extent that some people consider Cauchy

531
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,940
to be the real inventor,

532
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,940
or the real discoverer of calculus,

533
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,940
because he presented the concept of limits.

534
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,940
Because for many people,

535
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,940
limits are calculus.

536
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,940
The differentiation and integration of the limits,

537
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,940
is just a tool that you use

538
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,940
to solve the physics problems

539
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,940
or the mathematical problems that you have.

540
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,940
But the concept,

541
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,940
the foundation,

542
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,940
the mathematical reasoning of calculus,

543
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,940
is almost exclusive in the limits.

544
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,940
Understanding the limits is not easy.

545
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,940
Understanding the limits requires work from you,

546
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,940
because if you understand it,

547
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,940
the rest will be a piece of cake.

548
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,940
The infinitesimals numbers began to be shaken,

549
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,939
Until a German scientist came after Cauchy and refined Cauchy's limits.

550
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,940
because Cauchy's limits had ambiguity,

551
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,940
so he refined it,

552
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,940
and this was the last nail in the infinitesimals numbers' coffin.

553
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,940
And the limits took off.

554
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:46,940
The limits were trying to solve this problem,

555
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,940
and they really did.

556
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,940
After all this,

557
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,940
in the late 18th century,

558
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:59,940
and the beginnings of the 19th century,

559
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,940
no, sorry,

560
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,940
in the late 19th century,

561
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,940
and the beginning of the 20th century,

562
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,940
or the first period of the 20th century,

563
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,940
another scientist appeared.

564
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,940
This man in particular,

565
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,940
I have to write his name,

566
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,940
this man's name is

567
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,940
George Cantor.

568
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,940
George Cantor,

569
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,940
if we had not made a film of his life,

570
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,940
now we must make a film of it.

571
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,940
This man's life story was a tragedy,

572
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,940
it was very exciting and sad,

573
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,940
and unfortunately,

574
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,940
it is a tragedy to some extent.

575
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,940
This man began to talk about very important theories in this part.

576
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,940
This man, in the end,

577
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,940
he is the boss of real numbers

578
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,940
he did not talk about the limit specifically,

579
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,940
or his calculations were not in the specific limits,

580
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,940
his calculations were in changing the point of view of people in mathematics,

581
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,940
to numbers,

582
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,940
and specifically in real numbers,

583
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:05,940
which directly affects people's understanding of limits.

584
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,940
This man presented the set theory,

585
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,940
number theory,

586
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,940
the continuum,

587
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,940
the cardinality,

588
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,940
the cardinality of the continuum,

589
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,940
the nested intervals,

590
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,940
the amount of theorems this man made,

591
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:22,940
and presented a new door in mathematics,

592
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:26,940
which we now call set theory.

593
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:34,940
The problem is that when he presented all these concepts at the beginning,

594
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,940
no one expressed it,

595
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,940
even though he was a well-known scientist,

596
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,940
he was originally a German scientist,

597
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,940
but he was born in Russia and returned to Germany after that,

598
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,940
and studied mathematics in famous German universities.

599
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,940
But when he started talking about set theories,

600
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,940
no one cared.

601
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,940
The problem was that they started attacking him to the extent that he was humiliated,

602
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,940
and stopped his career in many stages,

603
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,940
because he had the opportunity to go and hold a post at the Berlin University,

604
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,940
and they stopped his teacher, who was not convinced of his theories.

605
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,940
This teacher was one of the most negatively affected people in his life,

606
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:14,940
he was even called the corrupt of the youth,

607
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,940
which means that he is a messed-up guy,

608
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,940
and he is a boy who mess-up the youth around him,

609
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:25,940
because he was teaching these techniques to his colleagues in mathematics.

610
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,940
The situation became very bad with him,

611
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,940
to the extent that he entered depression,

612
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:39,940
and he spent the last 15 or 20 years of his life moving from mental institute to mental institute.

613
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,940
People have frustrated the man in his life.

614
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,940
His son died at that time, and his condition deteriorated more,

615
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,940
and he was going out and working a little,

616
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,940
and he get more confused,

617
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,342
and he go to another institute.

618
00:28:51,343 --> 00:28:54,914
In the end, the man got to a point where here retired from mathematics

619
00:28:54,915 --> 00:28:57,400
and he went to teach philosophy,

620
00:28:57,401 --> 00:28:59,939
and then he left philosophy and taught literature,

621
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,940
and specialized in the literature of the time of Shakespeare and Queen Elizabeth,

622
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,940
and then he returned to mathematics again.

623
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,940
In the end, the man remained in mental institue,

624
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,940
and out of mental institue,

625
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,940
until he died in the last one of them,

626
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,940
he entered about 4 or 5 times,

627
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,940
and died in the end in a mental institue in 1918.

628
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,940
In the near end of his life,

629
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,940
people began to realize that this man was not crazy,

630
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,940
this man was speaking very important words,

631
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,940
and today,

632
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,940
one of the most important branches of mathematics,

633
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,940
and one of the most important branches of mathematics,

634
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,940
which is very advanced,

635
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,940
is the theories that this man is the founder of.

636
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,940
Why do we say this?

637
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,940
This man changed people's understanding of real numbers,

638
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,940
and as long as your understanding of real numbers changes,

639
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,940
your understanding of limits changes,

640
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,940
and if you want to understand limits correctly,

641
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,940
you must understand the next point,

642
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:56,940
which is the properties of,

643
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,940
I will not write real numbers here,

644
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,940
I will write numbers in general.

645
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,940
This is our course.

646
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,940
We will talk at the beginning about the properties of numbers,

647
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,940
then we will talk about functions,

648
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,940
of course, functions are the most important concept in mathematics in general,

649
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,940
so we will talk about functions,

650
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,940
I will write it here,

651
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,940
functions,

652
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,940
so we will talk here,

653
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,940
we will talk about functions,

654
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,940
and from functions we will talk about limits,

655
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,940
and from limits we will talk about differentiation and integration,

656
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,940
sequences and series are in different places in the course,

657
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,940
we will talk about complex numbers,

658
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:41,940
which is also related to the properties of numbers,

659
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,940
because they provide us with a new type of numbers,

660
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,940
so,

661
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:55,940
the purpose of this introduction was to show you that calculus is not just differentiation and integration,

662
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,940
and not just limits,

663
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,940
they are many things in each other,

664
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,940
because calculus as a subject is part of the largest branch in mathematics,

665
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,940
called real analysis,

666
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,940
and this is one of the very important fields in mathematics,

667
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,940
we do not have to go into it,

668
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,940
but at least we should understand this frame very well,

669
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:21,940
if you want to have a strong future in any study in physics,

670
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,940
and any study in engineering,

671
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,940
or of course,

672
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,940
I am sure it is in any advanced mathematics,

673
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,940
you will work in it, God willing, in the future,

674
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:34,940
we come to the source that we will work from in this course,

675
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,940
of course, there are many books,

676
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,940
the most famous book is considered as an introduction to calculus and real analysis,

677
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,940
a book by an American scientist named Michael Spivak,

678
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,940
I think this man is still alive, he was born in 1940,

679
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,940
he wrote the book that we will work from,

680
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,940
or the first copy or version of it,

681
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,940
he was 67,

682
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,940
he was 27 years old,

683
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,940
this is the year he took his PhD,

684
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,940
although he wrote this book when he was very young,

685
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,940
as I told you, this book is considered the calculus book for many people,

686
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,940
they consider that in order to study calculus,

687
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,940
you must read this book at a certain stage in your life,

688
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,940
in order to keep your name,

689
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,940
this is the book that we will work from, God willing,

690
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,940
see you in the next video,

691
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,940
peace be upon you.
