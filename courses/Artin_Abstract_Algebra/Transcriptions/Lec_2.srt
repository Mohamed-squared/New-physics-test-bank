1
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:20,110
Reminder, the syllabus is posted on the web and in the course is part of the FAS web page under math 122.

2
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,590
The extension school syllabus is posted under E 222. Yeah?

3
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,320
So what they ask for login?

4
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:36,420
Ah, is I I going to give you Now it's described on the web page how you log in. As as you get for the first two weeks you log in under guest with no password.

5
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:47,410
Okay? Eventually we'll get the student IDs in the course and you'll log in as yourself. Initially, guest, password just leave it blank and you get in. So it's essentially an open web page at the moment.

6
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:48,880
Okay?

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:58,580
Uh, you'll find the homework posted there, you'll find videos of the lectures posted there, you'll find uh notes for the lecture scanned in there.

8
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:18,020
So a lot of information. And the way you'll find it is it'll open up, you can open up a calendar and in September, you can click on the date of the lecture and then there are various choices labeled by letters, say H for homework and V for video and right? N for notes.

9
01:18,020 --> 00:01:28,010
And then you click on those and you see Peter's notes or you see the video of me lecturing or you can uh or you can get the homework assignment. We'll also post answers to the homework assignment there.

10
01:28,010 --> 00:01:33,040
So the web page should be up and functional if you're having any problems with the web page, send email to Peter.

11
01:33,570 --> 00:01:53,990
We're also getting the CAs lined up in the course. We hope to have two CAs lined up for the students taking this course, 122 and one CA lined up for E 222. And please fill out, if you will, the section time preference survey on Tuesdays and Thursdays so we can find times to schedule those sections that agree with most of the people in the class.

12
01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,360
The homework, as I pointed out last time, will be assigned every lecture and do the next lecture.

13
01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,420
You can hand them in today to Peter and he'll distribute them to get them graded.

14
02:03,680 --> 00:02:18,550
The homework for the extension course will be due weekly and uh you'll talk to JC Gets, who is running the section for uh the extension school. I think I should talk to the camera when I talk to the extension school students because they're all out there in the wild blue yonder. Yes.

15
02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,820
J.

16
02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,750
J.

17
02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,620
J, J, excuse me. Jace.

18
02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,020
I'm always pronouncing the last letter of your name. I don't know why. I have a friend named Jace.

19
02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,930
So I I transfer them to you. Jace Gets. Thank you. I apologize.

20
02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,810
Um, we'll introduce all the we'll introduce all the CAs on Friday once we have things finalized.

21
02:39,210 --> 00:02:54,570
And the homework due next time, since I might as well put it up while we're talking about homework, which you can find on the web page is to read sections 2.1 and 2.2 in Arton Algebra, which is the book.

22
02:57,090 --> 00:03:15,610
And the problems are 2.15 0.1.5, 2.1.7, 2.2.1, 2.2.15 and 2.2.20 part A.

23
03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,900
Homework. So that's what's due on Friday.

24
03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,330
Okay, so let's get to the lecture now.

25
03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,930
So last time, I reviewed some concepts from linear algebra.

26
03:29,840 --> 00:04:00,560
and defined our first group, which was the group I called GLN of R, which is the set of all invertible n by n matrices A with entries Aij in the real numbers.

27
04:01,630 --> 00:04:15,920
You could also there are other groups you could do if you didn't want to work with vector spaces over the real numbers, you could you could also define a group GLNC, which would be the same thing where the entries of the matrix were complex numbers.

28
04:16,660 --> 00:04:29,630
Or you could define the group GLN Q. This is complex numbers, this is the field of rational numbers.

29
04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,800
Same thing where the entries are rational numbers. We'll start with the the real numbers.

30
04:37,350 --> 00:04:52,780
And and at the end, I talked about how this was uh in some sense contained in a rather natural group. And let's remember first of all what a group is. So having defined this, we we showed that it was a group.

31
04:52,980 --> 00:04:59,770
And a group is by definition

32
05:02,710 --> 00:05:32,050
All are groups G. And group G is by definition one, a set with a product structure. So by that means if you have two elements in the set, A and B are in the group, then you get a new element A.B, the product of A and B, which is a new element in the group. So there has to be a product.

33
05:33,090 --> 00:05:40,930
And the second thing is the product must be associative. That's the most important thing to check.

34
05:41,420 --> 00:05:49,530
Namely A times B * c has to always equal A * B * c.

35
05:49,960 --> 00:06:12,900
That's a tricky property. Uh and Artin shows and you can go over his proof. It's a it's a somewhat meaningless proof by induction, but you should at least see it that once you have this associativity, then the product of any N elements in the group is well-defined independent of the order that you take the product. Once you have associativity for three elements, you have it for more than three elements.

35
06:13,830 --> 00:06:27,660
And the second condition is the existence of an identity, which I'll denote E, which has the property that the product of any element with the identity is the product of the identity element with is A.

36
06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,950
So every element, no matter how you product it with the identity gives you itself.

37
06:32,210 --> 00:06:50,780
And the fourth condition is the existence of inverse, and that means that for every element, there's an inverse, which denoted A inverse in the group, with the property that no matter how you multiply A by A inverse in either order, you get back to the identity.

38
06:51,670 --> 00:07:03,590
Those are the properties that characterize a group, rather simple properties. Uh and we saw that the matrices which were invertible formed a group under matrix multiplication.

39
07:14,560 --> 00:07:29,000
Sociativity is rather difficult to check from the definition of matrix multiplication, but if you think of matrices as representing linear operators and multiplication being composition of linear operators, I'll leave this up as the homework for next time for those who come late.

40
07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,990
Uh then it's clear that the composition of three operators is the same, no matter how you compose them.

41
07:35,580 --> 00:07:47,440
The identity element is the identity matrix with all ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere, and the inverse element is the inverse matrix, and that's why we have to assume that we only took invertible matrices here.

42
07:48,160 --> 00:08:08,930
And I also ended with the prototypical example of a group, even more prototypical than this example, uh which is the automorphisms of a set. Uh the the the or group, I'll call it or being the city in which uh which all started is the um is the symmetries of a set T.

43
08:15,940 --> 00:08:22,020
this is just an arbitrary set, and the symmetries of a set are all bijections of T.

44
08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,690
Bijection being a one-to-one onto map of the set to itself.

45
08:35,080 --> 00:08:46,950
And the group operation is composition. So a. B of an element T is by definition A of B of T. That's how we're going to do it.

46
08:47,150 --> 00:08:58,220
So first apply B to the set, that gives you a new element in the set, then apply A to that element, that gives you a third element to the set. That's the that's the mapping that A. B does to the set.

47
08:58,550 --> 00:09:08,520
And you check that the composition of bijections is a bijection. However, it needn't be equal to the composition in the opposite order, as we're going to see.

48
09:09,680 --> 00:09:17,580
Uh the identity element is just the the bijection that takes every element in the set to itself.

49
09:18,430 --> 00:09:27,780
And the inverse element, A inverse is defined as the element that takes the element A of T back to the element T.

50
09:27,780 --> 00:09:41,470
And since every element in the set can be written as A of T uniquely, because A was a bijection, this defines a bijection of the set T, and it clearly has the property that when you compose it with A, you get to E.

51
09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,600
You have to check in the opposite direction, but it also works.

52
09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,840
Please.

53
09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,980
You use the term automorphism?

54
09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,600
Uh automorphism is the same as bijection.

55
09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,730
I'm sorry if I used that term, but we might as well get into it.

56
09:54,990 --> 01:01,780
So morphism in mathematics means a map between sets, and automorphism means a bijective map.

57
01:02,170 --> 01:15,850
So sometimes people will refer to this group as the automorphism group of T or all automorphisms of the set T.

58
01:16,270 --> 01:18,780
Automorphism is exactly the same word as bijection.

59
01:20,480 --> 01:22,770
It's a little bit more Greek. Okay?

60
01:24,000 --> 01:24,620
Good.

61
01:24,870 --> 01:34,770
Please just stop me. I'm going to sometimes slip into jargon. Part of this part of this uh course is so you can speak enough jargon to sound like a mathematician and confuse everyone else.

62
01:35,320 --> 01:43,720
One of the things that mathematicians found out when they started talking to theoretical physicists over the last 30 years is that we were doing exactly the same thing but had different words for it.

63
01:44,330 --> 01:50,500
So when physicists said things like D brain, mathematicians would say, but that's just the manifold.

64
01:51,030 --> 01:54,910
So a lot of it is learning the difference, the words that are used to express the same thing.

65
01:55,810 --> 01:56,430
Okay?

66
01:57,000 --> 02:03,120
So this is this is some sense the or group, almost all groups come in some way from the symmetries of a set.

67
02:03,120 --> 02:13,620
For example, this group is contained in the automorphisms or the symmetries, sorry, of the set R to the N.

68
02:14,470 --> 02:22,320
Namely, these are certain bijections of the set R to the N. They're the bijections that preserve the linear structure.

69
02:22,920 --> 02:25,960
Right? That's when you get a matrix when you have a linear transformation.

70
02:25,960 --> 02:34,630
You could have other maps of the real line to itself that were bijections that weren't necessarily of the form X goes to AX.

71
02:35,190 --> 02:35,590
Right?

72
02:36,830 --> 02:44,190
You could have, for example, the bijection X goes to X cubed. That's a bijection of the real line to itself.

73
02:44,940 --> 02:57,210
So, there are more symmetries of Rn that are contained in n by n matrices, but these are certainly a subset of this. And in fact, they're what we call a subgroup.

74
02:57,210 --> 03:12,870
So that's another definition to uh to learn, a subgroup H of a group G denoted like that is a subset that is closed under multiplication, contains the identity and contains inverses.

75
03:13,600 --> 03:32,210
So it should be closed under it's a subset which is closed under multiplication, contains the identity, and closed under inverses. Namely, if A is in H, A inverse also has to be in H.

76
03:32,810 --> 03:41,630
So let's observe that this is a subgroup of this. I have all the bijections of Rn, and then I have the ones which are the linear bijections.

77
03:48,370 --> 03:57,160
of Rn. There were the ones that are represented by n by n invertible matrices.

78
03:57,620 --> 04:02,850
Let's see. If I have two linear bijections and I compose them, I get a third linear map.

79
04:03,470 --> 04:10,530
That's closed under multiplication because remember, multiplication here is composition of maps.

80
04:11,180 --> 04:14,900
Does it contain the identity map that takes every vector to itself?

81
04:15,220 --> 04:18,110
You bet. That's given by the identity matrix.

82
04:19,390 --> 04:19,700
Right?

83
04:20,540 --> 04:24,480
If an element is linear, is its inverse linear? Yes.

84
04:25,790 --> 04:33,570
Consequently, this subset is closed under multiplication, it contains the identity, it contains inverse, it's a subgroup of this.

85
04:33,920 --> 04:45,930
We're going to see all kinds of examples of groups defined as subgroups of the symmetry group of a set by putting more conditions on it. It not only takes elements of the set to itself, but it preserves this structure on the set.

86
04:46,660 --> 04:48,550
That's the usual way you get a group.

87
04:49,310 --> 04:50,000
Okay?

88
04:50,430 --> 05:05,300
And this is the way they appear in mathematics because you whenever you have a mathematical object, or in physics, for example, the group theory exploded in physics in the 20th century when people started to realize that the forces operating on an object might be radially symmetric.

89
05:06,310 --> 05:07,910
See, that's an extra symmetry.

90
05:08,100 --> 05:13,300
So you might exploit the fact that you have a group acting on the set that you're studying.

91
05:13,870 --> 05:17,600
So this is this is the way groups really appear, not as not as symbols.

92
05:17,600 --> 05:47,740
So, as I ended last time with the with the famous example, which is the way courses on group theory usually start, although Artin very wisely identifies these uh these matrix groups as more fundamental, and they are, they come up much more in mathematics because linear algebra is is the central subject of mathematics. You cannot learn too much linear algebra. That's a basic principle for all of you going on in mathematics. Linear algebra is presented as sort of stupid stuff. You cannot learn too much linear algebra.

93
05:48,220 --> 05:59,900
So here's the here's a nice group called SN, which is the symmetry group of the set 1, 2, 3 n - 1 n. The set a finite set of n elements.

94
06:01,250 --> 06:16,620
sometimes called the permutation group on n letters. Because an automorphism of this set just reassigns the reassigns the places in line.

95
06:17,630 --> 06:34,190
And we saw that this is a finite group because there are only finitely many permutations of a set of n letters, and the order of it, that's the size of the the set underlying the group is n factorial.

96
06:35,530 --> 06:38,880
I might write that this way. This is the way Artin would write that.

97
06:38,880 --> 06:45,870
The order of the symmetry group SN is n factorial because there are n factorial ways to permute n letters.

98
06:46,240 --> 06:55,840
Why? Because there are n choices for the letter you take first, and then there are n - 1 choices for the letter you take second, and then there are n - 2 choices for the letter you take third.

99
06:57,000 --> 06:57,400
Okay.

100
06:57,870 --> 07:04,020
Let's take a look at the symmetric group on a few small letters to get an idea how we would uh analyze it.

101
07:04,020 --> 07:06,200
So the simplest one is S1.

102
07:06,960 --> 07:12,850
S1 is a very simple group because the only permutation of a set of one element is the identity.

103
07:13,700 --> 07:14,930
So there that's a famous group.

104
07:15,420 --> 07:24,310
That's the simplest group you can have because any group has to contain an identity element, which happens to be its own inverse and etc, etc, etc.

105
07:25,120 --> 07:27,910
So that's an easy group, has one element in it.

106
07:27,910 --> 07:36,510
You can't have you can have a set with zero elements, right? The empty set, but you can't have a group with zero elements. Simplest group you have is one element.

107
07:36,930 --> 07:38,080
How about S2?

108
07:38,670 --> 07:46,780
Well, there's the identity map that takes let's let's denote a let's write our permutation like this. This would be the identity permutation.

109
07:47,850 --> 07:55,660
Takes one to one and two to two, but there's another element in this group that takes one to two and takes two to one.

110
07:56,820 --> 07:59,700
Let's call that permutation Tau.

111
08:01,840 --> 08:06,990
Okay, so S2 is a set which has two elements in it, E and Tau.

112
08:08,400 --> 08:11,090
That those are the only possible permutations of two letters.

113
08:11,610 --> 08:14,000
And we want to know what the multiplication law is.

114
08:14,490 --> 08:29,020
Well, if we compose any any permutation with the identity permutation, we get itself. So obviously you have E tau is equal to tau E is equal to is equal to tau.

115
08:29,550 --> 08:31,810
What about if I compose tau with tau?

116
08:33,560 --> 08:34,400
It's E.

117
08:35,050 --> 08:43,090
If I if I do this twice, so I take one to two, then I take two to one, it goes back to one, and then I take two to one, and I do it again, one goes to two, so two goes to two.

118
08:44,250 --> 08:52,790
So, here I have this law. So in other words, Tau in this group is equal to Tau inverse because it is the transformation that multiplies by Tau to get E.

119
08:54,150 --> 09:03,220
So that's a pretty simple group. It has two elements in it, the identity and a non-identity element. And the non-identity element when I multiply by itself, I get back to E.

120
09:03,640 --> 09:12,020
So the multiplication table, if you really wanted to write this thing out, which I don't recommend ever doing, would look like this.

121
09:13,810 --> 09:14,360
Okay?

122
09:15,230 --> 09:21,010
Now, that's Now that's an example of a group that I called last time, abelian or commutative.

123
09:21,290 --> 09:39,350
So if AB is equal to BA for all pairs, say G is a billion or commutative.

124
09:40,730 --> 09:46,600
Some people capitalize a billion in honor of Able, some people don't. Doesn't make any difference to me.

125
09:47,780 --> 09:55,940
So, uh this group is commutative. commutative group just means that the multiplication table is symmetric around the diagonal and this one is.

126
09:58,750 --> 10:04,980
Let's take an example which is a little bit more interesting where we go to the permutations of three elements.

127
10:07,400 --> 10:08,660
I'm now going to erase the homework.

128
10:09,330 --> 10:11,700
In fact, I'm going to erase the definition of a group.

129
10:34,840 --> 10:35,530
S3.

130
10:36,280 --> 10:39,440
So, of course, we have the identity element. That one we already knew about.

131
10:40,080 --> 10:52,040
Now, we have an element like this Tau, namely, we can forget about the fact that we have three elements, leave the third element fixed and just permute the first two like that.

132
10:52,460 --> 10:55,080
Let's call that element Tau. We've already seen that element.

133
10:56,050 --> 11:03,820
Now, elements in the symmetric This is by the way called the symmetric group or permutation group on N letters.

134
11:03,820 --> 11:07,020
symmetric group on N letters.

135
11:08,100 --> 11:26,620
I'm sorry for all these different terminologies for the same thing like automorphisms and symmetries, but um it's good to at least know what they are. People only realized how fundamental a group was at the end of the 19th century and already they had a lot of different language for it. So we at least have to know what the words are.

136
11:27,450 --> 11:38,300
Um, if you have the these kinds of symmetries where you only exchange two elements, well, that was obvious in this case, are called transpositions.

137
11:49,990 --> 12:02,850
So if if you have a a very simple type of of uh permutation is to fix everything but two elements and just exchange those two. Those are called transpositions. They're very important as we'll see later on in the theory of the symmetric group.

138
12:03,860 --> 12:11,130
Now, in this case, we have this transposition, but we also have some others. Can someone tell me some other transpositions in the symmetric group on three letters?

139
12:11,760 --> 12:12,430
Yeah.

140
12:18,740 --> 12:19,570
Right.

141
12:19,850 --> 12:25,920
So there are three different elements we could fix, right? We could fix three, but we could also fix two, we could also fix one.

142
12:26,420 --> 12:36,360
So uh there are actually three transpositions. I'll write them down. So we could fix one and switch two and three. Let's call that one Tau prime.

143
12:37,090 --> 12:49,950
Or we could exchange one and three and fix two. Those are all three different I could call that Tau double prime.

144
12:51,790 --> 13:01,270
So so far we've found four different permutations of the set of three elements. We ultimately have to find three factorial, which is six. So there have to be two more permutations of three elements.

145
13:04,290 --> 13:08,140
So I'll write you down a new another one that isn't a transposition.

146
13:08,140 --> 13:13,490
If it's not a transposition, it can't fix anything because there're only three elements.

147
13:13,490 --> 13:20,440
So once it fixed one element, it would have to either fix them all or or just exchange the other two. We've already written down all of those.

148
13:20,890 --> 13:28,530
So let's write down something that doesn't fix anything. Well, we can take one to two and two to three and three back to one.

149
13:28,970 --> 13:31,000
Let's call that one Sigma.

150
13:31,860 --> 13:48,970
Or another possibility, instead of taking one to two, we could take one to three, right? Then we could take two, I guess it would have to go to um to one, and three goes to two.

151
13:49,470 --> 13:51,210
Let's call that one sigma prime.

152
13:53,920 --> 14:02,540
So we have three transpositions, the identity element and these two elements that don't fix anything, but represent different permutations. So those are the six elements of S3.

153
14:03,290 --> 14:09,180
E Tau, Tau prime, Tau double prime, Sigma, Sigma prime.

154
14:11,230 --> 14:12,920
Now, the fun starts.

155
14:13,490 --> 14:24,300
Let's see if we can find let's see what the composition of these things looks like. In particular, let's see if this group is uh commutative.

156
14:24,930 --> 14:31,140
So, let us compute Tau sigma and let us then compute sigma Tau.

157
14:32,070 --> 14:37,330
Now how do you compute tau sigma? Well, you have to figure out what it is as a permutation of the set of three elements.

158
14:37,330 --> 14:41,610
So the first thing I'd want to know is what does it do to the element one?

159
14:43,060 --> 14:43,870
Well, let's figure that out.

160
14:43,870 --> 14:51,980
This says, first now this notation means, first apply sigma to one and then apply tau to what sigma takes one two.

161
14:52,390 --> 15:00,510
So this becomes tau of sigma of one. Sigma of one is by definition two.

162
15:03,350 --> 15:07,180
Right? And Tau of two is one.

163
15:07,510 --> 15:11,360
So this becomes Tau of two, which becomes one.

164
15:12,210 --> 15:16,740
So this permutation, whatever it does, it fixes one.

165
15:18,270 --> 15:19,990
It fixes the element one.

166
15:20,290 --> 15:21,830
Now I can tell you right away what it is.

167
15:22,500 --> 15:26,940
There are only two of these six permutations that fix the element one.

168
15:27,320 --> 15:27,900
What are they?

169
15:29,720 --> 15:30,840
It could be E.

170
15:32,570 --> 15:42,770
So, so tau sigma is either E or tau prime.

171
15:43,960 --> 15:53,780
Now, I claim that it isn't E. That I can tell you right away without even thinking about it, by pure thought, that it isn't E, without computing what it does to two.

172
15:43,960 --> 15:53,780
Now, I could check by just seeing what it did to two.

173
15:57,920 --> 15:58,170
Let's do that.

174
15:58,170 --> 16:01,350
That's the that's the computational approach.

175
16:01,690 --> 16:02,040
Proof.

176
16:02,500 --> 16:13,640
Tau sigma of 2 Well, we first compute sigma of 2, that's 3. It's Tau of 3. And Tau of 3 happens to be three.

177
16:15,350 --> 16:26,010
So, it's beginning to look much more like Tau prime because it fixed one and it took two to three. Now that says it has to take three to whatever whatever's left because it's a bijection.

178
16:27,000 --> 16:31,960
So that that immediately implies that Tau sigma is equal to Tau prime.

179
16:33,550 --> 16:37,480
That's the that's our multiplication table we're starting to work out. But

180
16:37,930 --> 16:55,710
if I wanted to do it by pure thought, without ever computing what it did to two, how do you think I could eliminate the fact that Tau Sigma could not be equal to E? Given the fact that this is a group? Yeah, go ahead.

181
16:55,710 --> 16:56,290
Ah!

182
16:56,290 --> 16:57,930
They're clearly not inverse of each other.

183
16:57,930 --> 17:07,460
What is the inverse to Tau? Tau. That's all you have to say. Inverses are unique. The only possible thing that when you multiply by Tau, you get back to the identity is Tau.

184
17:08,100 --> 17:10,630
Sigma doesn't look like Tau.

185
17:11,130 --> 17:24,240
So, but you could also argue, very good, that the inverse of Tau is equal to Tau.

186
17:24,240 --> 17:26,060
By the way, what's the inverse of Sigma?

187
17:27,040 --> 17:29,160
Can anyone tell me what the inverse of Sigma is?

188
17:29,160 --> 17:31,800
What? Ah, very good.

189
17:32,310 --> 17:35,240
Sigma inverse is equal to sigma prime.

190
17:35,490 --> 17:47,440
If you look at it, if you want to get this back to where you started, you have to take two to one, you have to take one to three, and you have to take three to two. That's what sigma prime is.

191
17:48,460 --> 17:54,080
So, with these six elements, this is just the fun, you know, now you can start taking products and inverses.

192
17:54,080 --> 17:58,310
But in any case, we've computed that Tau Sigma is Tau prime.

193
17:59,590 --> 18:00,370
We've got that.

194
18:00,370 --> 18:02,130
Let's now compute what sigma tau is.

195
18:03,190 --> 18:06,170
Well, we'll compute sigma tau by computing it on one.

196
18:07,730 --> 18:10,000
Okay, we start off by Tau of one is two.

197
18:10,390 --> 18:11,870
So this is sigma of two.

198
18:13,450 --> 18:16,680
And sigma of 2 is 3.

199
18:17,470 --> 18:20,130
So sigma tau of 1 is 3.

200
18:21,530 --> 18:22,170
Interesting.

201
18:22,680 --> 18:24,550
So there are two possibilities for it.

202
18:25,050 --> 18:32,560
It could be it could be tau double prime, or it could be sigma prime.

203
18:32,980 --> 18:34,480
We're again down to two possibilities.

204
18:35,190 --> 18:41,260
Well, let's compute sigma tau of 2 just to just to to kill the suspense of it all.

205
18:41,570 --> 18:44,490
Tau of 2 is one, so this becomes sigma of one.

206
18:44,850 --> 18:46,590
Sigma of one is two.

207
18:47,200 --> 18:53,360
So it fixes two and therefore it's equal to tau double prime, right?

208
18:54,050 --> 18:57,970
So therefore sigma tau is equal to tau double prime.

209
18:59,520 --> 19:02,480
Here, fixes two, takes one to three.

210
19:03,710 --> 19:07,450
And therefore, sigma tau is not equal to tau sigma.

211
19:12,120 --> 19:18,490
So already, in this incredibly simple permutation group on three elements, it's non-abelian.

212
19:19,620 --> 19:20,220
Okay?

213
19:20,930 --> 19:23,420
llary, let's let's push our luck.

214
19:24,620 --> 19:25,400
llary.

215
19:27,090 --> 19:41,580
The group SN, the symmetric group on N letters is non-a billion for all n larger than or equal to 3.

216
19:42,520 --> 19:52,780
So once we permute more than three elements, we have a non-abelian group. Well, what are we going to do? Are we going to write down all the n factorial things and find two things that don't commute?

217
19:53,450 --> 19:54,760
Let's think for a second.

218
19:55,160 --> 19:56,300
Let's think for a second.

219
19:57,820 --> 19:58,950
Did you want to say something?

220
19:59,950 --> 20:06,510
How can we exhibit? How can we prove this corollary just from this stupid computation?

221
20:06,930 --> 20:07,580
Go ahead.

222
20:10,460 --> 20:11,820
Bravo. Excellent. Proof.

223
20:14,200 --> 20:28,690
S3 is a subgroup of SN fixing the the letters 4, 5, 6 up to n.

224
20:28,940 --> 20:44,100
Namely, if I take inside of the permutation group, the subset of permutations that fix all the letters after three, then that is the permutation group on three letters because all I have left is to arrange how I permute the first three letters around.

225
20:45,000 --> 20:45,470
Right?

226
20:45,960 --> 20:58,050
And that's a subgroup of SN because if I compose two permutations that fix all these letters, they still fix it. If I take the inverse of something that fixes these letters, it still fixes it, and the identity element fixes them.

227
20:58,450 --> 20:59,500
So this is a subgroup.

228
21:00,640 --> 21:04,240
Once n is bigger than or equal to 3, S3 is a subgroup of SN.

229
21:04,760 --> 21:20,680
I have two elements in S3 that don't commute, namely Sigma and Tau, and those give me elements in SN that don't commute. Namely, just take these poor permutations sigma and tau and extend them to permutations of the whole set that fix 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 up to n.

230
21:21,760 --> 21:23,830
So you already see that subgroups are very good.

231
21:23,830 --> 21:27,790
If you can find a subgroup of a group that's non-a billion, the group is non-a billion.

232
21:27,990 --> 21:31,050
Because all you have to do is find two elements in the group that don't commute.

233
21:31,660 --> 21:35,470
And if you can find two elements in the subgroup that don't commute, they certainly don't commute in the group.

234
21:36,520 --> 21:40,050
Because their products are different elements of the subgroup, so they're different elements in the group.

235
21:41,460 --> 21:42,110
Okay.

236
21:44,340 --> 21:44,940
Please.

237
21:46,240 --> 21:50,830
Sorry, I think I sort of missed something a second ago when you were talking about the secondary way to see that

238
21:50,830 --> 21:55,970
How to argue that sigma Tau, Tau Sigma is not equal to the identity.

239
21:56,450 --> 22:06,630
Okay. If it were equal to the identity, then Sigma would be an inverse to Tau because the inverse is the unique element in the group that the product hits the identity.

240
22:07,220 --> 22:12,530
If it were the identity, that would say sigma is tau inverse. But looking at them, they're not inverses of each other.

241
22:13,110 --> 22:15,470
Because the inverse to a transposition is itself.

242
22:15,960 --> 22:22,830
If you have a transposition, then you find tau is equal to tau inverse. For all transpositions, you have that property.

243
22:23,430 --> 22:28,160
Whereas here, we didn't find sigma is equal to sigma inverse, its inverse with sigma prime.

244
22:29,470 --> 22:32,210
I'll do one more example of a subgroup for you.

245
22:33,170 --> 22:41,140
So here we saw, we got a subgroup by asking that it permuted something, but it fixed something inside of that set.

246
22:41,470 --> 22:42,840
That's a very good way of getting subgroups.

247
22:42,840 --> 22:58,870
For example, I claim that for any K less than or equal to n, SK is a subgroup of SN. Same argument. It fixes all the letters past K.

248
23:03,590 --> 23:14,290
permutations fixing K + 1, K + 2 up to n.

249
23:16,410 --> 23:24,690
So you very frequently get subgroups by insisting that they fix something, and then when you compose two symmetries that fix something and fixes something, etc.

250
23:25,120 --> 23:26,550
Let's do that inside of GLN.

251
23:26,850 --> 23:53,000
So what is the subgroup of GL2R which fixes the line If I if I view GL2R is acting on R2, what about the subgroup of linear transformations that fix this line?

252
23:54,650 --> 23:58,030
So the line uh where Y equals 0.

253
23:59,870 --> 24:12,340
What is the subgroup that fixes that line? Well, let's think about it in matrix form. Now, you can see right away that that has to be a subgroup regardless of what the matrices in it look like because

254
24:14,270 --> 24:19,230
these are linear maps of R2 to itself which are bijections.

255
24:19,490 --> 24:24,420
If they fix this line and you compose two bijections fixing this line, it fixes the line.

256
24:24,650 --> 24:33,840
Fixing the line means, by the way, just keeping the line on itself. It it might it might move a vector here to a vector here or something, but it but at least it stabilizes the line.

257
24:34,580 --> 24:40,020
Maybe I should use that expression so that we don't get we don't think it fixes every vector on the line.

258
24:40,350 --> 24:41,580
stabilizing.

259
24:42,210 --> 24:47,040
That's clearly a subgroup because composition of two things that stabilize this line stabilizes the line.

260
24:47,380 --> 24:52,250
If a map stabilizes this line, so does its inverse. The identity certainly stabilizes this line.

261
24:53,430 --> 24:56,730
So, there is some subgroup. What does it look like matricially?

262
24:57,770 --> 25:04,220
So if you have a matrix, A B C D, which is invertible,

263
25:04,560 --> 25:11,410
what does it mean that it fixes the first basis vector? It means that the entry B in the matrix is zero.

264
25:12,710 --> 25:21,730
Right? Because this column represents the transformation on the first basis vector, and this column represents the transformation on the second basis vector.

265
25:22,090 --> 25:29,300
And to say that the linear transformation fixes this line says it takes the first basis vector into some multiple of the first basis vector.

266
25:30,060 --> 25:37,170
Right? So the coefficient of the second basis vector in the matrix would be zero. By the way we represent linear transformations by matrices.

267
25:38,070 --> 25:43,850
So, a matrix will fix this line if and only if the B entry is zero.

268
25:44,190 --> 25:52,610
And then we want it to be invertible, so that would just means that its determinant is non zero. So AD is not equal to zero.

269
25:53,340 --> 25:57,990
That's the subgroup of 2x2 matrices that fix the line.

270
25:58,310 --> 26:01,450
And then we better check that it's closed under multiplication, huh?

271
26:01,980 --> 26:13,410
I mean, we might have gotten it wrong. So we better check that if we multiply two matrices that look like this, we get another matrix that looks like this.

272
26:14,730 --> 26:15,910
Well, do you believe it?

273
26:16,850 --> 26:20,230
We just have to check that this bottom entry is zero. So there's only one thing to check.

274
26:20,640 --> 26:33,690
So we have to go across this row and down this column and verify that the product is zero, and you get 0 * a prime plus D * 0. So the entry here is zero, it's sort of irrelevant what goes up here.

275
26:34,180 --> 26:36,630
So that shows that those matrices are closed under product.

276
26:37,060 --> 26:37,720
Yes.

277
26:41,840 --> 26:48,850
Very good point, but we know that because the product of two matrices with non-zero determinant have non-zero determinant.

278
26:49,270 --> 26:54,700
That's already the fact that it's a subset of GL2. This condition will be but you're you're absolutely right.

279
26:54,700 --> 27:02,280
In fact, why don't we check and see what the corners are just to just to verify that for ourselves. So this corner is A A prime.

280
27:04,030 --> 27:09,970
And this corner happens to be D D prime. And this thing is much more complicated.

281
27:10,800 --> 27:17,530
And certainly, if A * D and A prime * D prime are non zero, so is A A prime * D D prime.

282
27:18,060 --> 27:19,030
But good question.

283
27:20,380 --> 27:21,230
Good question.

284
27:22,350 --> 27:23,330
All set with this?

285
27:23,890 --> 27:28,330
So start to recognize subgroups. That's a that's a really big point. Now,

286
27:28,330 --> 27:34,250
Artin has a very nice exercise where he shows you what the subgroups are of the additive group of the integers.

287
27:34,250 --> 27:42,250
Let's do that. Sometimes it's possible in a group, very rarely, but sometimes it's possible to identify all the subgroups.

288
27:44,810 --> 27:47,210
So here's a proposition I'll prove for you.

289
27:47,210 --> 27:47,930
Proposition.

290
27:49,170 --> 28:19,720
The collection, the subgroups of the integers under addition, that's an abelian group, are precisely given by BZ or multiples of a fixed integer under addition.

291
28:22,610 --> 28:28,320
or multiplication.

292
28:29,440 --> 28:40,640
So, uh all even integers, or all integers divisible by three, or all integers divisible by five. So, we're going to check that that forms a subgroup and then we're going to prove that every subgroup has that form.

293
28:40,870 --> 28:49,520
By the way, I should have said in the definition of a subgroup, a mathematician gives you a definition, he should always follow it by the trivial examples.

294
28:50,210 --> 28:52,000
Right? Sometimes there are no more examples.

295
28:52,600 --> 28:54,050
Then it was a stupid definition.

296
28:55,120 --> 28:59,460
So, who can give me two completely trivial subgroups of any group?

297
28:59,820 --> 29:00,250
Yeah.

298
29:03,510 --> 29:03,960
Perfect.

299
29:04,210 --> 29:07,980
So any time you have a group, it forms a subgroup of itself.

300
29:08,330 --> 29:13,170
You didn't really need the notation to tell you that, but it's certainly closed under addition, identity, etc.

301
29:13,680 --> 29:23,800
And that's the biggest subgroup you can have. And the smallest subgroup you can have is when you have just the identity element, because it must contain the identity element. And then the subgroup is like the group with one element.

302
29:24,390 --> 29:25,760
Closed under okay?

303
29:26,100 --> 29:27,320
So you always have those two subgroups.

304
29:27,690 --> 29:33,600
Now, where are those two subgroups here? Which subgroup here is the identity element and which subgroup is the full group?

305
29:35,090 --> 29:36,640
Yeah, let's follow up. Go ahead.

306
29:37,490 --> 29:38,020
Good.

307
29:38,020 --> 29:49,520
B equals 0 gives the group zero under addition, which is just the the one element group.

308
29:50,120 --> 29:57,890
And B equal 1 gives H equal G because if you just take multiples of one, but the others are non-trivial subgroups.

309
29:58,430 --> 30:05,370
Even integers, integers divisible by three, integers divisible by 17, integers divisible by 21.

310
30:05,900 --> 30:06,760
Okay, proof.

311
30:09,290 --> 30:18,560
First, these are all subgroups. That's more or less clear.

312
30:18,560 --> 30:22,510
If you add two integers divisible by B, that's just things like this.

313
30:23,590 --> 30:29,580
B M plus bn is equal to B times m + n.

314
30:30,640 --> 30:35,800
Right? The negative of BM is B times - M.

315
30:36,220 --> 30:40,420
And 0 is equal to 0 * is equal to B * 0.

316
30:41,020 --> 30:48,890
So that shows that the zero element is in the group. This shows that we have inverses in the group, and this shows that the group is closed under addition.

317
30:49,850 --> 30:50,290
Okay?

318
30:50,610 --> 30:57,530
So, anything, all integers divisible by something give a subgroup of all integers under addition.

319
30:57,790 --> 31:01,620
We just have to show that these are the only possible subgroups.

320
31:03,490 --> 31:12,850
Okay. So, to show that these exhaust the subgroups, we're going to use a trick that goes back to book five and Euclid.

321
31:13,240 --> 31:25,900
So we to show these exhaust the subgroups, let HB a subgroup of Z

322
31:26,960 --> 31:42,240
and let let B be equal to the smallest integer uh well, there are two cases.

323
31:45,940 --> 31:49,500
Case one, H is equal to zero.

324
31:50,580 --> 31:51,950
So it's the zero subgroup.

325
31:52,260 --> 31:55,040
Well, that's one of these cases with B equals zero.

326
31:55,320 --> 31:56,100
So that's okay.

327
31:57,070 --> 32:04,730
In case two, H is not equal to the zero group. So it contains something other than the identity in it.

328
32:05,520 --> 32:09,740
Now, by taking inverses, we see that it has to contain something positive in it.

329
32:10,680 --> 32:16,240
So contains an M not equal to zero.

330
32:16,900 --> 32:32,220
Taking M or - M in H, we see it contains some integer M which is strictly greater than zero.

331
32:33,770 --> 32:41,970
Because it's closed under inverses. So if if you found it contained minus 3, it would also have to contain three.

332
32:44,210 --> 32:44,600
Okay.

333
32:44,960 --> 32:53,070
And then the trick of the Euclidean algorithm is to let B be the smallest possible integer, B greater than 0, be the smallest

334
32:56,370 --> 33:02,900
positive integer contained in H.

335
33:08,600 --> 33:11,970
So, since it contains positive integers, it contains a smallest one.

336
33:12,910 --> 33:13,300
Okay.

337
33:13,840 --> 33:20,470
Then the first observation is then H contains all multiples of B.

338
33:21,600 --> 33:27,470
Because once it has B in it, it has B + B, which is 2B, and then it has B + B + B, which is 3B, right?

339
33:28,400 --> 33:34,040
And then it has minus B, which is the inverse of B, then it has minus 2B, which is the inverse of 2B.

340
33:34,330 --> 33:35,250
Everyone agree to that?

341
33:35,880 --> 33:49,190
So once we find the smallest possible positive integer in it, it has to contain all multiples of this by closure under addition and inversion.

342
33:52,650 --> 33:55,430
Now, suppose there was something else in H.

343
33:55,880 --> 34:12,880
Suppose H is in H and write H as some multiple of B plus a remainder term with 0 less than or equal to R less than B.

344
34:13,520 --> 34:15,890
We can do that by the Euclidean algorithm.

345
34:16,270 --> 34:26,060
You can always subtract off some multiple of B from your integer that's in the group that makes the remainder less than B. If you think of the elements in the group on the real line here's zero.

346
34:26,470 --> 34:28,930
Here's our smallest element B, which is in H.

347
34:29,440 --> 34:31,850
Here's some other element H, which is in H.

348
34:32,160 --> 34:46,620
We just go marching off here in multiples of B until H is squeezed between two multiples of B, which means that if we subtract that multiple of B from H, the remainder is less than B.

349
34:7,380 --> 34:47,780
Okay?

350
34:49,110 --> 34:51,770
Now, I claim that R is equal to zero.

351
34:56,490 --> 35:02,570
which will show that H is actually a multiple of B, so that this exhausts the subgroup.

352
35:03,400 --> 35:14,530
And the proof is, if not, Why? Because R is actually an element in H.

353
35:16,220 --> 35:34,120
B is in H, so the multiple of B is in H, H is in H. So if I take H and I add to it the inverse of this, I get something in H. H + - MB is in H by the fact that H is closed under inversion and addition.

354
35:34,610 --> 35:37,550
But h + - MB is R.

355
35:38,420 --> 35:41,380
R was assumed to be a positive number less than B.

356
35:42,490 --> 35:45,950
B was assumed to be the smallest positive number in H.

357
35:46,390 --> 35:49,700
So the only way this can be the case is if the remainder is zero.

358
35:51,550 --> 35:59,940
So and r is less than B. So r is equal to zero, which says that everything in h is a multiple of B.

359
36:00,660 --> 36:10,100
So this is a nice application of the Euclidean algorithm, which is used to prove the existence of greatest common divisors and unique prime factorization in Euclid.

360
36:10,100 --> 36:18,480
But it also establishes, art and shows you a slightly more sophisticated algebraic fact that it allows you to identify all subgroups of Z with the multiples of a fixed number.

361
36:18,840 --> 36:21,870
And any multiple of a fixed number gives you a subgroup.

362
36:22,750 --> 36:23,310
Good?

363
36:24,050 --> 36:28,010
So there are an infinite number of subgroups of Z and uh there they are.

364
36:29,170 --> 36:34,730
Let me just end with one more definition and then Peter will pick up with this on Friday.

365
36:34,960 --> 36:40,300
So you get to see him lecture before you commit yourself irrevocably to this course.

366
36:47,780 --> 36:59,580
So, I want to talk about a certain type of subgroup that you get. So if you have any group G, any group, and you have an element G and G,

367
37:00,480 --> 37:16,260
there's a natural subgroup that I'll denote by H, which I'll write like this, which is sometimes called the cyclic subgroup generated by Z,

368
37:17,280 --> 37:24,480
which is consists of all products of G with itself. It's the smallest subgroup that could contain this element.

369
37:29,350 --> 37:34,610
smallest subgroup containing G.

370
37:36,170 --> 37:45,100
So it consists of things like E g Since it has g in it, it has to have g inverse in it, then it has to have g squared in it, then it has to have g the minus 2.

371
37:45,370 --> 37:47,600
So it consists of all powers of G.

372
37:53,390 --> 37:55,920
Where the zeroth power is defined to be the identity.

373
37:56,200 --> 38:03,760
Because if you have if you have the element G in it, you certainly have to have all powers of G in it if it's closed under multiplication and inversion.

374
38:04,230 --> 38:17,760
Moreover, once you get all powers of G in it, then um it's certainly closed under multiplication. You multiply two powers of G, you get another. I mean, the power law works in a group just like it does in normal arithmetic.

375
38:27,880 --> 38:35,600
The inverse of g to the M is g to the minus M, and that's contained in here.

376
38:36,520 --> 38:42,180
So this is certainly closed under addition and inversion and contains the identity element. So there it is. There's the cyclic subgroup.

377
38:42,480 --> 38:49,040
However, and it's a big caveat, don't necessarily think that those powers are distinct.

378
38:49,820 --> 38:54,460
And there's could be a point where you take the power and you get back to the identity element.

379
38:54,900 --> 39:02,940
We saw that in the symmetric group. In the in S3, we had this element Tau with the property that Tau squared was the identity element.

380
39:03,830 --> 39:10,930
So if we took the cyclic subgroup generated by Tau in S3, it would just be the group E Tau.

381
39:11,700 --> 39:14,250
It would be that subgroup of order two.

382
39:15,830 --> 39:22,750
So that's a big question, namely, what do you get to a power of G where it becomes the identity element or not?

383
39:23,070 --> 39:27,430
So if g to the M is equal to the identity

384
39:28,140 --> 39:37,780
and M is the smallest power, we say M is the order

385
39:42,280 --> 39:47,120
of G in G.

386
39:47,800 --> 40:01,630
And if if no power g to the M equals the identity smallest positive such power for M greater than zero, we say G has infinite order.

387
40:06,150 --> 40:17,400
So the elements in Z all have infinite order. once you get to an element which is except for zero, which has order one. Once you get to a positive integer, no matter how many times you add it to itself,

388
40:17,400 --> 40:24,200
you never get back to the identity because you keep marching out. But in the symmetric group

389
40:26,100 --> 40:30,950
on three letters, we find that this Tau has order two.

390
40:32,510 --> 40:33,770
Someone has a phone call.

391
40:34,050 --> 40:38,450
And then we find that sigma, if you cube it, you get to the identity has order three.

392
40:43,650 --> 40:44,860
Is that signify the class is over?

393
40:44,860 --> 40:47,180
All right, we're going to find a big theorem.

394
40:47,180 --> 41:00,720
Big theorem what's coming up is that in a finite group, every element has finite order and the order divides the order of the group. So here we got order two and three, huh, they both divide six.

395
41:01,670 --> 41:02,530
Big theorem.

396
41:02,530 --> 41:07,700
In an in an infinite group, elements can either have finite or infinite order. Peter will give you examples of that next time.

397
41:08,150 --> 41:08,670
Okay.
