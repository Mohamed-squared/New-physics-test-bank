1
00:12:745 --> 00:13:205
So let me just finish one thing I should have said about this uh isomorphism theorem or the quotient group.

2
00:13:205 --> 00:18:945
So let me just finish one thing I should have said about this uh isomorphism theorem or the quotient group.

3
00:18:945 --> 00:24:895
So last time we showed that if you had a a group G and you had a normal subgroup H,

4
00:24:895 --> 00:33:425
that there is a new group that one can construct, G mod H,

5
00:33:425 --> 00:38:445
quotient group

6
00:38:445 --> 00:45:115
of cosets of H.

7
00:45:115 --> 00:57:785
So the elements of this group are the cosets of H, that this comes with a natural surjective map F that takes an element in G into its H coset.

8
00:57:785 --> 01:02:805
That's a group homomorphism and the kernel of it is H. That's what we showed last time.

9
01:02:805 --> 01:07:785
So any normal subgroup gives rise to a diagram like this of groups.

10
01:07:785 --> 01:13:425
Now, let's make a a little observation which is quite useful.

11
01:13:425 --> 01:21:875
Namely, suppose that between G and H, we have another group uh called K.

12
01:21:875 --> 01:28:585
So K is a subgroup of G that contains the normal subgroup H.

13
01:28:585 --> 01:31:675
We'll have examples of this. All right.

14
01:31:675 --> 01:34:625
Then the claim is first,

15
01:34:625 --> 01:38:995
that H is normal in K.

16
01:38:995 --> 01:44:315
That's easy.

17
01:44:315 --> 01:52:495
Because to say h is normal in G means that for any g and G, g inverse is equal to h.

18
01:52:495 --> 01:55:895
For all g and G.

19
01:55:895 --> 02:02:905
Now, if if this is is true for all g and G, it's certainly true for all G in the subgroup K.

20
02:02:905 --> 02:06:945
Which is the statement that h is normal in K. That's easy.

21
02:06:945 --> 02:19:255
So therefore, we can construct the quotient group. So, have group K mod h.

22
02:19:255 --> 02:26:505
Which can be thought of as a subset of G mod H.

23
02:26:505 --> 02:32:765
These are precisely the H cosets that have contain elements in K.

24
02:32:765 --> 02:34:715
So here's the picture.

25
02:34:715 --> 02:45:935
If we take G and we divide it up into the distinct cosets for H, a certain number of them will form the subgroup K.

26
02:45:935 --> 02:52:595
Because K itself is a union of H cosets.

27
02:52:595 --> 03:00:735
And a certain number of them give you K and the rest of them give you G. So you get a group which is a subset of this group.

28
03:00:735 --> 03:04:335
All right? First statement, it's a subgroup.

29
03:04:335 --> 03:14:405
of g mod h.

30
03:14:405 --> 03:18:005
Because K is a subgroup of G.

31
03:18:005 --> 03:29:835
In other words, if I take two different cosets that lie in K, HA and HB, and I multiply them, that coset also lies in K.

32
03:29:835 --> 03:36:615
So it's so this subset of cosets that lie in K is closed under multiplication.

33
03:36:615 --> 03:37:585
Why?

34
03:37:585 --> 03:44:435
Because if I take two elements in K, A and B and I multiply them, I got a new element in K.

35
03:44:435 --> 03:46:985
That's because K is a subgroup.

36
03:46:985 --> 04:03:125
The cosets contained in K are stable under multiplication as K is stable under multiplication.

37
04:03:125 --> 04:07:195
Okay?

38
04:07:195 --> 04:18:065
So, if I have a group contained containing K H, then in the quotient group G mod H, I get the subgroup K mod H.

39
04:18:065 --> 04:20:755
Okay.

40
04:20:755 --> 04:25:225
Conversely, and this is very powerful.

41
04:25:225 --> 04:57:665
Any subgroup of G containing H corresponds to a subgroup of G mod H in this manner.

42
04:57:665 --> 04:59:065
What do I mean by that?

43
04:59:065 --> 05:19:895
Well, if I have a subgroup of G mod H, let's say that the subgroup consists of the cosets AH, a subset of the cosets of G mod H, and then I just take the union of all those cosets, I claim that gives me a subgroup of G.

44
05:19:895 --> 05:31:885
corresponding to the subgroup.

45
05:31:885 --> 05:39:075
So you have to check that that gives a subgroup of G containing H and that every subgroup of G containing H arises in that manner.

46
05:39:075 --> 05:48:165
So in other words, there's a bijection between the subgroups of G containing a normal subgroup and the subgroups of this quotient group.

47
05:48:165 --> 05:50:665
Okay?

48
05:50:665 --> 05:55:805
So that's an important. So I'll give you an example of this, which we'll use later on.

49
05:55:805 --> 05:59:215
Start with the group G is equal to Z.

50
05:59:215 --> 06:09:525
Under addition. Everything's normal. Okay?

51
06:09:525 --> 06:19:695
Now, suppose I ask you and let P be a prime number, and consider the subgroup H, which is multiples of P.

52
06:19:695 --> 06:26:755
Here's the claim.

53
06:26:755 --> 06:33:525
If we have a subgroup of Z, which lies between Z and PZ, is a subgroup, then either K is equal to the integers or K is equal to PZ.

54
06:33:525 --> 06:36:285
is a subgroup.

55
06:36:285 --> 07:04:885
Then either K is equal to the integers or K is equal to PZ. In other words, there's nothing properly in between those two subgroups.

56
07:04:885 --> 07:08:565
And the proof,

57
07:08:565 --> 07:34:215
such a K gives a subgroup of the cyclic group quotient group Z mod PZ.

58
07:34:215 --> 07:40:605
We showed that a group of prime order had no non-trivial subgroups.

59
07:40:605 --> 07:45:525
Right? Because the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group.

60
07:45:525 --> 07:56:225
So gives either the zero subgroup or the entire group.

61
07:56:225 --> 08:02:305
That was by our result about groups of prime order. They had no non-trivial subgroups.

62
08:02:305 --> 08:16:375
And if the subgroup of this quotient group is zero, that means that K corresponds to PZ because it's given by the union of cosets in that subgroup and the only coset in that subgroup is is H. So you get PZ.

63
08:16:375 --> 08:27:875
And on the other hand, if the subgroup of this cyclic group is the entire group, then the subgroup H K is the union of all the cosets of H, namely it's this group.

64
08:27:875 --> 08:44:435
So we might say, so we might restate this claim as the statement that this is a maximal subgroup of G.

65
08:44:435 --> 08:50:335
maximal meaning anything larger than it is the entire group. You can't get any bigger.

66
08:50:335 --> 08:51:855
Okay?

67
08:51:855 --> 08:55:355
So that's some kind of way we're going to use this quotient theorem.

68
08:55:355 --> 09:10:885
We're going to use it to pick out sub you get a wonderful thing from this, uh, this picture, namely any subgroup of G containing H maps to a subgroup here, and any subgroup of g mod H, if we take the inverse image under this map.

69
09:10:885 --> 09:11:885
That's all this is, by the way.

70
09:11:885 --> 09:21:935
This is the inverse image of the subgroup of g mod h in G.

71
09:21:935 --> 09:30:175
The the set of all things mapping to the subgroup, that gives us a subgroup K and G that corresponds bijectively to the subgroup of g mod h.

72
09:30:175 --> 09:40:895
And so if we can say something about the quotient group, like we can in this case, that it has no non-trivial subgroups, we know that there's nothing squeezed between Z and PZ. Okay?

73
09:40:895 --> 09:42:615
Good.

74
09:42:615 --> 09:49:775
This is the end of what I'm going to say about groups for a while. And now we're going to go into the theory of abstract vector spaces. Peter, you have something for me?

75
09:49:775 --> 09:51:785
You even have the homework, you mean?

76
09:51:785 --> 09:55:285
The basic operations.

77
09:55:285 --> 09:57:795
I mean, what I'm supposed to be talking about? Okay.

78
09:57:795 --> 10:00:535
It's all up here. It's all up here. Um, you know, uh,

79
10:00:535 --> 10:09:755
there's a great line in Amadeus, which actually seems to have been an actual quote of of Mozart's.

80
10:09:755 --> 10:21:075
Uh, Mozart used to write his symphony sometimes in the in the carriage once he took a trip from Vienna to Prague and wrote an entire symphony in the carriage.

81
10:21:075 --> 10:23:765
And just got off and wrote it down on the paper.

82
10:23:765 --> 10:25:485
And in Amadeus, uh,

83
10:25:485 --> 10:38:895
the uh the man who commissioned the Magic Flute, which was really a popular opera, not a serious opera in that in Mozart's time, paid Mozart a considerable advance to write the magic flute.

84
10:38:895 --> 10:46:045
Uh was harassing him uh about when he was actually going to produce the opera.

85
10:46:045 --> 10:52:545
He goes, they were going to go into production in a week. And Mozart said, it's all up here. The rest is scribbling.

86
10:52:545 --> 10:53:985
So, okay.

87
10:53:985 --> 10:56:215
So the rest is scribbling.

88
10:56:215 --> 10:59:705
So now we're going to go to the operation on vector spaces.

89
10:59:705 --> 11:05:095
So vector spaces are something you've seen already in your courses on linear algebra.

90
11:05:095 --> 11:10:345
And usually people study vector spaces in linear algebra over the real numbers.

91
11:10:345 --> 11:18:605
Reals or complex numbers.

92
11:18:605 --> 11:22:335
Because that's our geometric intuition of what a vector space looks like.

93
11:22:335 --> 11:29:495
And a vector space V, I'll always denote V for a vector space over R,

94
11:29:495 --> 11:36:785
consists of first an Abelian group.

95
11:36:785 --> 11:51:495
So that means you can add vectors with operation plus and identity element, what's called the zero vector, or sometimes just zero.

96
11:51:495 --> 11:56:955
And inverse element sometimes called minus B.

97
11:56:955 --> 12:03:075
So the this is the operation of the Abelian group in a vector space is written additively like it is for the integers.

98
12:03:075 --> 12:10:595
Now, this would be perfectly good example of this would be the integers, but the integers aren't a vector space. And the second thing you need is you need a scalar multiplication

99
12:10:595 --> 12:20:955
by elements C in your real numbers, for example.

100
12:20:955 --> 12:22:055
So in other words,

101
12:22:055 --> 12:24:235
a billion group,

102
12:24:235 --> 12:27:825
the elements of the group are usually denoted little V.

103
12:27:825 --> 12:34:535
So associated the operation plus means that you can take two elements of V and add it and get a V plus W, that sort of thing.

104
12:34:535 --> 12:40:055
So you can also take an element in this Abelian group and you're allowed to multiply it by a scalar.

105
12:40:055 --> 12:45:425
So there should be some operation that takes V to C times V where C is a real number.

106
12:45:425 --> 12:52:055
So it's a little more than an Abelian group. It has this scalar multiplication.

107
12:52:055 --> 12:58:415
And that scalar multiplication has to also satisfy some identities. For example,

108
12:58:415 --> 13:04:745
if you multiply by the zero scalar times any vector, you have to get the zero vector.

109
13:04:745 --> 13:11:405
And if you multiply by the one scalar times any vector, you have to get the vector itself.

110
13:11:405 --> 13:13:615
Right?

111
13:13:615 --> 13:17:775
And if you do um, there's various associative laws.

112
13:17:775 --> 13:25:365
So if you multiply two scalars, a times B, and then you scalar multiply that by a vector, that's A of B times a vector.

113
13:25:365 --> 13:29:965
So here's the first scalar multiplication of vector, here's the second scalar multiplication of vector.

114
13:29:965 --> 13:35:735
Then there's distributive laws um that relate these two operations.

115
13:35:735 --> 13:44:645
So this is something I think you're familiar with, at least I hope. And and geometrically, one supposed to uh view vector addition, for example, in the plane, which is

116
13:44:645 --> 13:48:985
This is an example of a vector space. V is equal to sometimes called R.

117
13:48:985 --> 13:51:745
So sorry. So examples of vector spaces.

118
13:51:745 --> 13:58:405
The simplest example is zero.

119
13:58:405 --> 14:02:155
The vector space consisting of one element, zero.

120
14:02:155 --> 14:06:945
You can have right? You can have a group of one element, you can have a vector space with one element.

121
14:06:945 --> 14:12:475
It's kind of stupid. Here it is. There's the zero dimensional vector space.

122
14:12:475 --> 14:18:685
Then you can have a vector space which is slightly more non-trivial consisting of all real numbers.

123
14:18:685 --> 14:26:825
Where you add them, just using the addition law in the real numbers, and you scalar multiply by scalar multiplying real numbers.

124
14:26:825 --> 14:33:855
That vector space we frequently denote by the real line like this. Here's the zero vector, here's the one vector, etc.

125
14:33:855 --> 14:35:325
And of course,

126
14:35:325 --> 14:43:885
you go on and you define more complicated vector spaces, for example, R to the N,

127
14:43:885 --> 14:48:465
which is what one usually experiences first in in linear algebra.

128
14:48:465 --> 14:59:785
And this vector space of vector consists of N real numbers component wise where the AI are reals.

129
14:59:785 --> 15:04:325
And you add them by adding component vectors.

130
15:04:325 --> 15:19:455
So V + W where W has the entry B would be a1 + B1, a2 + B2 AM + BN where W is the vector B1 through BN.

131
15:19:455 --> 15:28:395
And if you want to multiply by a scalar, you multiply the scalar times each space vector.

132
15:28:395 --> 15:31:625
And that satisfies the axioms of a vector space.

133
15:31:625 --> 15:49:235
And if I wanted to draw a picture of R2, which one frequently does, the vectors in R2 would be the would have coordinates A1, A2, where this would be A1 in this direction and A2 in this direction.

134
15:49:235 --> 16:03:345
And when you add vectors, as you've probably learned, you do it by the parallelogram law. If I can draw it, this would be the vector up here V plus W.

135
16:03:345 --> 16:08:965
And when you scalar multiply vectors, you just scale them up and down the line that they're on.

136
16:08:965 --> 16:17:425
So it's very good when you're when you're thinking about real vector spaces to have this geometric intuition in mind. That's where they came from. They were formalizing geometric operations.

137
16:17:425 --> 16:27:325
Of course, in this vector space, because it's over the real numbers, we have other, we have other um properties beyond just addition and scalar multiplication.

138
16:27:325 --> 16:30:905
For example, we have the notion of the length of a vector.

139
16:30:905 --> 16:42:615
In RN can define things like inner products, v. W, you can define the length of a vector, things like that.

140
16:42:615 --> 16:48:965
This is this is given by the summation of AI BI. It's a funny product operation.

141
16:48:965 --> 16:55:795
This is the square root of the sum of the AI squared gives the Euclidean length of a vector.

142
16:55:795 --> 17:05:825
So there are many, many things one can do in this vector space that are very useful for calculus, like you want to say when two vectors are close to each other, the length of their difference should be small.

143
17:05:825 --> 17:15:835
But you can't do in a general vector space. So, so remember that the dot products and the the absolute value of a vector, that's something we're not doing here. This is just abstract spaces.

144
17:15:835 --> 17:26:815
Now, when we do linear algebra, we're going to do the same things for vector spaces, but not necessarily where you can scalar multiply by the real numbers.

145
17:26:815 --> 17:38:545
We are going to study now the theory of vector spaces over a field F.

146
17:38:545 --> 17:43:885
So before I tell you what a vector space over a field F is, I have to tell you what a field is.

147
17:43:885 --> 17:48:935
So a field is going to be something that abstracts what the real numbers are, what the complex numbers are.

148
17:48:935 --> 18:06:675
And it's going to be exactly the right setting so that the basic results that we're familiar with in linear algebra, like vector spaces have a dimension, and there is a basis for a vector space that has the number of elements, which is the dimension of a space. All that kind of stuff works.

149
18:06:675 --> 18:27:925
So people, once they understood the sort of basic properties of this, they said, well, why do we need our geometric intuition anymore? Maybe we can formulate the right mathematical notion to capture all the notions of dimension and bases and linear independence and span, um, and all the techniques of linear algebra, matrices and solutions of linear equations over an arbitrary field.

150
18:27:925 --> 18:30:585
So what do you need to have a field?

151
18:30:585 --> 18:44:915
So a field is defined as following. It's on the one hand, it's an Abelian group under addition.

152
18:44:915 --> 18:58:075
So it's a set which forms an Abelian group under addition with the identity element zero, with the inverse identity element and inverse is minus A.

153
18:58:075 --> 19:01:315
So that's the first condition.

154
19:01:315 --> 19:18:555
The second condition, which is that there's always a multiplication law and every so if you take F minus the zero element, which is a distinguished element in this abelian group, and you call that F star,

155
19:18:555 --> 19:31:745
So that set forms an Abelian group under multiplication.

156
19:31:745 --> 19:39:765
With identity element, the element we call one, that's another distinguished element in the field.

157
19:39:765 --> 19:47:185
And inverse element denoted by A inverse or 1/ A.

158
19:47:185 --> 19:51:215
So you have to have two Abelian groups to get yourself a field.

159
19:51:215 --> 20:01:265
An addition group, which is easy, and then the multiplication group, which has to work for every nonzero element. So, in other words, every nonzero element has an inverse. That's critical.

160
20:01:265 --> 20:11:695
has a multiplicative inverse.

161
20:11:695 --> 20:14:415
So, for example, the integers,

162
20:14:415 --> 20:22:945
which form a very nice abelian group, which have a very nice multiplication law. Everything is good about them, except that you can't invert two.

163
20:22:945 --> 20:27:525
Because if you tried to invert two, you'd find the number one half, which is not an integer.

164
20:27:525 --> 20:38:015
So, here you have to be able to invert everything. And of course, the addition law and the multiplication law have to be compatible in that there's a distributive law, etc, which you can find

165
20:38:015 --> 20:39:835
in the book.

166
20:39:835 --> 20:49:075
So, for example, the real numbers form a field because everything non-zero is invertible. Same thing with the complex numbers. The rational numbers form a field.

167
20:49:075 --> 20:54:655
set of all quotients, A over B, B not equal to zero. Looks simple, but you have to remember that A over B is equal to

168
20:54:655 --> 21:02:865
a prime over B prime if AB prime is equal to B prime. I mean, there are various identifications of rational numbers, like 2/3 is the same as 4/6.

169
21:02:865 --> 21:08:045
So, uh, but but everyone has some pretty good idea of what the rational numbers are.

170
21:08:045 --> 21:14:735
The integers are not a field.

171
21:14:735 --> 21:22:235
Now you can talk about sub fields of a field, that makes a lot of sense.

172
21:22:235 --> 21:27:195
So if you have one field and you have a subset of it,

173
21:27:195 --> 21:52:675
You'd say it's a subfield if closed under plus and times and closed under inverses in both in both groups.

174
21:52:675 --> 21:58:485
So it's a subgroup under addition and the the nonzero elements form a subgroup under multiplication.

175
21:58:485 --> 22:09:405
So you might notice that in this case, Q is a subfield of R. It's closed under addition and multiplication. and R is a subfield of the complex numbers.

176
22:09:405 --> 22:16:835
And there are a lot of things in between. Believe me there is, not here, but between here and here, there are a lot of interesting fields.

177
22:16:835 --> 22:33:125
And you might ask and people started out with the notion of whether these were the only fields? Namely was every field some considered a subfield of the complex numbers? Could we construct anything else that was completely different than the complex numbers or the real numbers?

178
22:33:125 --> 22:38:975
Because if if if there were no other interesting fields, we wouldn't have any other interesting theory of vector spaces.

179
22:38:975 --> 22:41:325
Okay?

180
22:41:325 --> 22:46:045
So, we might try to construct the field by hand.

181
22:46:045 --> 22:47:985
Why not?

182
22:47:985 --> 22:54:775
Now, as I said, whenever you define an object mathematically, you should look for the simplest possible example.

183
22:54:775 --> 23:01:875
Now, the simplest example of a group or a vector space has one element in it. Here it is.

184
23:01:875 --> 23:04:185
It's got to have the identity element.

185
23:04:185 --> 23:18:155
Now, the simplest element of a the example of a field has to have more than one element because you insist in the definitions that the identity element for addition and the identity element for multiplication are distinct elements.

186
23:18:155 --> 23:20:695
In that's part of the definition.

187
23:20:695 --> 23:22:835
So there must be at least two elements.

188
23:22:835 --> 23:31:855
So any field, no matter how it's constructed, has to contain the identity element for addition and the identity element for multiplication.

189
23:31:855 --> 23:33:265
Okay?

190
23:33:265 --> 23:40:625
So if we're going to make the stupidest possible field, we should try to make it out of those two elements.

191
23:40:625 --> 23:43:785
Can we do it? So, in fact, yes.

192
23:43:785 --> 23:47:525
The simplest field

193
23:47:525 --> 23:55:345
has two elements. Okay.

194
23:55:345 --> 24:01:875
I have to give you the addition law and the multiplication law. Here's the addition law.

195
24:01:875 --> 24:09:355
When you add zero to anything, you have to get itself.

196
24:09:355 --> 24:14:825
That's part of zero is the identity element for addition, right?

197
24:14:825 --> 24:19:825
So 0 + 0 is 0. 0 + 1 is 1. 0 + 1 is 1.

198
24:19:825 --> 24:22:685
All I have to tell you is what 1 + 1 is.

199
24:22:685 --> 24:25:215
We'll call 1 + 1 0.

200
24:25:215 --> 24:28:885
That's my definition of what 1 + 1 is.

201
24:28:885 --> 24:31:525
And now I have to give you the multiplication law.

202
24:31:525 --> 24:41:235
It turns out that zero times anything in a field, part of a things that Artin will show you is zero.

203
24:41:235 --> 24:46:335
And one the identity element times itself has to be the identity element. So multiplication is more or less forced.

204
24:46:335 --> 24:58:085
If you take this addition, you get a group under addition. and in fact, this group is the group that I would call the cyclic group of order two.

205
24:58:085 --> 25:05:485
And then if you impose this multiplication on it, it turns out to be a field.

206
25:05:485 --> 25:09:855
With identity element, the non-trivial element of this group.

207
25:09:855 --> 25:11:105
Okay?

208
25:11:105 --> 25:13:905
There's there's the first example of a field. Yeah.

209
25:13:905 --> 25:17:435
If you were to find 1 + 1 You'd get into trouble with the distributive laws, etc.

210
25:17:435 --> 25:22:585
And also you wouldn't get a group because um, yeah, I mean 1 + 1 is 1

211
25:22:585 --> 25:29:125
won't do for a group because then there's a unique identity element in a group.

212
25:29:125 --> 25:45:195
So, so 1 + 1 equals 1 would imply that one is equal to the additive identity which is equal to zero, which is a contradiction because in the field one was not supposed to be equal to zero.

213
25:45:195 --> 25:46:455
Okay?

214
25:46:455 --> 25:53:465
So this is forced on us, this is forced on us. Either this works or it doesn't, it turns out to work.

215
25:53:465 --> 25:57:325
More generally,

216
25:57:325 --> 26:09:855
If P is a prime number, then Z mod PZ

217
26:09:855 --> 26:34:105
with the multiplication inherited from Z. In other words, a * B bar times B bar is congruent to a B bar mod P.

218
26:34:105 --> 26:43:775
Namely, you represent the classes by integers, you multiply them and you take the remainder after division by P, the way Peter described the multiplication table to you on Z mod NZ.

219
26:43:775 --> 26:48:775
is a field.

220
26:48:775 --> 26:53:875
So that's a remarkable example. We saw that this was not just an Abelian group, but it had a multiplication on it.

221
26:53:875 --> 27:03:975
And the claim is that that multiplication has the property that every nonzero element is invertible.

222
27:03:975 --> 27:06:225
However,

223
27:06:225 --> 27:11:115
and this is a little warning sign by the way that was invented by Borbaki.

224
27:11:115 --> 27:28:985
It means take care. You know, it's like in the game um Milborne where you know, you put out the rule, rule, and you know, and then all at once it's, you know, attention, attention. Attention. Z mod NZ is not a field

225
27:28:985 --> 27:39:705
if n is composite.

226
27:39:705 --> 27:43:885
So we're not going to get any more fields this way. It's only when n is a prime

227
27:43:885 --> 27:51:485
that this Abelian group with its natural multiplication is a field.

228
27:51:485 --> 27:54:755
Okay? Now I have to prove it for you.

229
27:54:755 --> 27:58:785
This by the way is P equal 2.

230
27:58:785 --> 28:15:855
You see, if you think of this product law, this is multiplication of even and odd numbers, right? If you multiply an even number by an even number, you get an even number. An even number by an odd number, you get an even number. An even number by an odd number, you get an even number. And an odd number by an odd number, you get an odd number.

231
28:15:855 --> 28:18:545
That's multiplication in Z mod 2.

232
28:18:545 --> 28:20:745
Okay? Let's prove this.

233
28:20:745 --> 28:26:935
So this is this is non-trivial.

234
28:26:935 --> 28:30:725
Okay?

235
28:30:725 --> 28:33:225
To prove this,

236
28:33:225 --> 28:42:755
we must show that if A is not congruent to zero mod P,

237
28:42:755 --> 28:52:455
So that's a non zero element of this Abelian group. That's an element in F star.

238
28:52:455 --> 29:10:255
Then there is an integer B such that a * B is congruent to one mod P.

239
29:10:255 --> 29:17:415
We showed this. We did? You did it already?

240
29:17:415 --> 29:21:945
Oh, it's so shocking. I was going to do this brilliantly with my

241
29:21:945 --> 29:27:545
All right, well, I'm going to do it better. I'm going to do it better.

242
29:27:545 --> 29:32:105
Maybe you did it this way. Let's see if Peter is a genius as I am.

243
29:32:105 --> 29:39:685
You see that would be then then then B then B would be congruent to A inverse mod P.

244
29:39:685 --> 29:44:065
There are many ways to slice this this lemon. All right, here we go.

245
29:44:065 --> 29:46:965
So the proof goes like this.

246
29:46:965 --> 29:55:375
Recall from 30 minutes ago

247
29:55:375 --> 30:03:135
that PZ in Z is a maximal subgroup.

248
30:03:135 --> 30:05:415
See Peter, maybe he had that.

249
30:05:415 --> 30:14:515
But he hadn't done it by the isomorphism theorem, right? Because we showed there were no groups between Z and PZ. All right.

250
30:14:515 --> 30:27:575
Now, if A is not congruent to zero mod P, then A is not an element of the subgroup PZ.

251
30:27:575 --> 30:37:745
We agree on that? That's our hypothesis. We have a nonzero element mod P, means it's not divisible by P, so it's not in here.

252
30:37:745 --> 30:38:345
Hence,

253
30:38:345 --> 30:54:025
if we adjoin A to this subgroup, we have to get the entire group Z. PZ + AZ is equal to Z.

254
30:54:025 --> 31:04:925
Because this means all integer multiples of P plus all integer multiples of A.

255
31:04:925 --> 31:24:595
Because this is a subgroup as this is a subgroup of Z containing PZ, but not equal to PZ because it contains the element A, which is not in PZ.

256
31:24:595 --> 31:27:865
So once it's bigger than PZ, has to be the whole thing.

257
31:27:865 --> 31:30:785
Agreed? So it's Z.

258
31:30:785 --> 31:37:755
So that means if I take any element in Z, I can write it as a multiple of P plus a multiple of A.

259
31:37:755 --> 31:43:465
So write the element one as some multiple of P plus some multiple of A.

260
31:43:465 --> 31:49:885
Since one is an element in Z,

261
31:49:885 --> 31:53:785
I can write it as a multiple of P plus a multiple of A.

262
31:53:785 --> 31:56:755
And now look at this identity mod P.

263
31:56:755 --> 32:04:485
That says that one is congruent to BA mod P because this is divisible by P.

264
32:04:485 --> 32:07:665
And there is my inverse B.

265
32:07:665 --> 32:10:855
Similar to what you did, Peter? You did the Euclidean algorithm?

266
32:10:855 --> 32:13:315
Okay. It's the same thing.

267
32:13:315 --> 32:21:755
It's the same thing, but I got I was a little fancier because I did this business about subgroups of Z containing PZ a little earlier.

268
32:21:755 --> 32:22:665
Okay?

269
32:22:665 --> 32:29:995
So there's my inverse. It's true for every nonzero element of the set. So there's my field.

270
32:29:995 --> 32:35:005
Now, notice that this field is way different than the complex numbers.

271
32:35:005 --> 32:39:695
Let's see what's so different about this field and the complex numbers.

272
32:39:695 --> 32:40:685
It couldn't be a subfield, for example, of the complex numbers.

273
32:40:685 --> 32:46:515
Namely, first of all, has a finite number of elements. It's a field with P elements.

274
32:46:515 --> 32:47:655
Okay?

275
32:47:655 --> 32:50:095
Now, uh,

276
32:50:095 --> 33:02:855
Z mod PZ is not a subfield of C.

277
33:02:855 --> 33:10:975
And the reason is very simple. In any field, you have the element one.

278
33:10:975 --> 33:16:115
Right? A field has to have a multiplicative identity. one.

279
33:16:115 --> 33:22:925
And since you can, you can add one to itself any number of times.

280
33:22:925 --> 33:31:825
So you can add it to itself n times. And you get a new element in the field.

281
33:31:825 --> 33:34:385
Okay?

282
33:34:385 --> 33:39:735
for every integer n.

283
33:39:735 --> 33:45:835
Okay. Now, in the complex numbers, when you keep adding one to itself,

284
33:45:835 --> 33:58:875
you just keep marching out in the complex plane. Here's one, here's two, here's three, here's four, here's five. You got a bunch of distinct elements.

285
33:58:875 --> 34:13:445
Okay? So these are all distinct in subfields of C.

286
34:13:445 --> 34:21:155
Because any subfield of C contains the element one, and since and it's closed under addition, so it contains two, and then it contains three, and then it contains four, etc.

287
34:21:155 --> 34:29:265
However, in this field, when you take the element one and you add it to itself P times, you get back to the origin.

288
34:29:265 --> 34:41:995
because 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 P times is equal to 0 in Z mod PZ.

289
34:41:995 --> 34:43:665
That's a huge difference.

290
34:43:665 --> 34:54:105
And so you could never put this field inside of this one because one would have to go to one if you had a proper embedding of fields and then two would have to go to two and and in here all those numbers are non zero.

291
34:54:105 --> 34:58:195
And here when you do it P times, you get to zero.

292
34:58:195 --> 35:03:865
And that's a big um distinction of fields. how many times you have to add one to itself to get zero?

293
35:03:865 --> 35:11:545
If you never get zero, uh then you're like the complex numbers. And if uh I should say by the way, that Galois made a

294
35:11:545 --> 35:20:055
Gaois, our friend who did group theory, made a big discovery about fields. And in some sense, after

295
35:20:055 --> 35:27:745
they understood that this was a field, Gaois asked himself the question,

296
35:27:745 --> 35:38:275
what are the finite fields?

297
35:38:275 --> 35:47:345
Beyond Z mod PZ. Namely, the finite groups, that's a really interesting question.

298
35:47:345 --> 35:53:805
We don't even know the the final answer to that. But finite fields, Gaois realized he could make a list of them.

299
35:53:805 --> 35:58:645
Well, you have one for each prime P. So the first thing is you might want to know

300
35:58:645 --> 36:11:765
what is the order of F for a finite field?

301
36:11:765 --> 36:13:765
Can you have a finite field? Here's a finite field of order

302
36:13:765 --> 36:19:745
two and three. Is there a finite field of order four? Is there a finite field of order five? Yes.

303
36:19:745 --> 36:24:395
Is there a finite field of order six? We don't know. So what Ga proved is

304
36:24:395 --> 36:36:545
the answer to this is P to the N for a prime P and an integer n bigger and equal to one.

305
36:36:545 --> 36:45:615
So you don't have a finite field of order six. No matter how hard you try, you can't construct something which has order six and has all the axioms of a field.

306
36:45:615 --> 36:48:115
But um, and he also proved

307
36:48:115 --> 37:01:355
that for each P and N, there is a unique such field

308
37:01:355 --> 37:03:505
up to isomorphism.

309
37:03:505 --> 37:09:425
We're going to do that later. That'll be one of the crowning joys of this course. Gaois classification of finite fields.

310
37:09:425 --> 37:16:075
So, there this is the only field which has P elements.

311
37:16:075 --> 37:19:325
And there's a field which has four elements.

312
37:19:325 --> 37:21:835
And there's a field that has eight elements, which we haven't seen yet.

313
37:21:835 --> 37:23:935
And there's a field with 16 elements. There's a field with 27 elements.

314
37:23:935 --> 37:27:515
There's no field with 28 elements. So that's one thing we're going to get to.

315
37:27:515 --> 37:34:145
But at least we have a large supply of finite fields looking at us that we can work with.

316
37:34:145 --> 37:39:435
Now, having defined what a field is, I can tell you what a vector space is over a field.

317
37:39:435 --> 37:50:655
And that's going to be the setting for the linear algebra we're going to pursue in the next couple of lectures. Okay.

318
37:50:655 --> 38:02:635
So a vector space over a field is a set V, a set of vectors with the following properties.

319
38:02:635 --> 38:16:795
One, V is an Abelian group under addition with identity element 0 V, just like it was for the real numbers, etc, etc.

320
38:16:795 --> 38:33:955
And the second, and here's where the field comes in, there's an operation called the scalar product

321
38:33:955 --> 38:46:805
from V cross F into V that takes a vector and a scalar in the field F to the vector

322
38:46:805 --> 38:53:995
C times V. And it has to obey various rules with respect to the addition and the associative rule.

323
38:53:995 --> 39:06:995
And we have to have that zero times any vector is 0V, where this is the zero element of the field, and one times any vector is V where one is the one element of the field.

324
39:06:995 --> 39:12:835
So, uh, and the associative law is usual, AB times a vector is

325
39:12:835 --> 39:15:745
A times B of a vector.

326
39:15:745 --> 39:22:705
The distributive law, A * V + C, V + W, etc is AV + AW.

327
39:22:705 --> 39:31:235
So exactly the laws that we had for vector spaces over the real numbers, but now we allow ourselves to multiply by scalars.

328
39:31:235 --> 39:37:255
And I should give you some examples of vector spaces because we already saw some examples of real vector spaces.

329
39:37:255 --> 39:45:595
And they work just as well for examples of vector spaces over fields.

330
39:45:595 --> 39:57:805
The first example is the zero vector space. Works just as well.

331
39:57:805 --> 40:02:745
The second example is the field itself.

332
40:02:745 --> 40:05:805
It forms a vector space over the field.

333
40:05:805 --> 40:07:725
can multiply by scalars.

334
40:07:725 --> 40:15:555
The third example, why not, is uh n tuples of elements in the field.

335
40:15:555 --> 40:23:395
So this consists of all tuples A1, an such that the AI are elements in F.

336
40:23:395 --> 40:28:065
You add them component wise using the addition law of the field.

337
40:28:065 --> 40:32:695
You scalar multiply in each component using the multiplication law in the field.

338
40:32:695 --> 40:35:735
All that works fine.

339
40:35:735 --> 40:46:775
Those are kind of boring examples of vector spaces, but we're going to see that uh vector spaces all look kind of like that, at least if they have a finite dimensional basis.

340
40:46:775 --> 40:50:455
A more interesting example of vector space.

341
40:50:455 --> 40:55:265
Here's a here's a one that we're going to study a lot later. I'll denote it like this.

342
40:55:265 --> 40:57:755
F brackets X.

343
40:57:755 --> 41:11:605
That's the vector space of all polynomials P of X with coefficients in our field F.

344
41:11:605 --> 41:15:705
That's a much more interesting vector space.

345
41:15:705 --> 41:27:935
You can multiply in that vector space because you can multiply polynomials, but forgetting the multiplication of polynomials, we can certainly add two polynomials and we can certainly multiply a polynomial by a scalar.

346
41:27:935 --> 41:32:425
And if we just keep that structure, we get the polynomials.

347
41:32:425 --> 41:34:505
Okay?

348
41:34:505 --> 41:43:105
Questions on the the definition or the definition of a field or the examples of fields we've got so far?

349
41:43:105 --> 41:45:705
This pretty familiar material? Yeah, this is I

350
41:45:705 --> 41:55:385
gather a little bit of review, but we have to we have to do this material if we're going to get seriously involved in uh the linear algebra groups later.

351
41:55:385 --> 41:58:535
Do I need the other distributive property?

352
41:58:535 --> 42:01:575
Do I need the other distributive property? Yes.

353
42:01:575 --> 42:07:895
A + B * V is AV Thank you. BV.

354
42:07:895 --> 42:10:925
You know, you have Never mind.

355
42:10:925 --> 42:14:715
Um, those exercises are pointless.

356
42:14:715 --> 42:29:195
Um, this remember that these things are taking place in different things. Namely, here you add the two scalars and then you scalar multiply by V. And here you're scalar multiply by A on this vector, you scalar multiply by V on this vector, and then you add the two vectors.

357
42:29:195 --> 42:31:885
each one of these laws. Okay.

358
42:31:885 --> 42:39:375
All right. Now, um just as we did for groups, we're going to have all kinds of concepts when we have sub objects, homomorphisms.

359
42:39:375 --> 42:46:725
So we say W in V is a vector subspace

360
42:46:725 --> 42:59:135
if it's a subgroup under plus contains zero.

361
42:59:135 --> 43:13:115
Of course, that means that's what it means to be a subgroup under plus. And uh and is stable under scalar multiplication by F.

362
43:13:115 --> 43:18:495
So an example, if we took the vector space

363
43:18:495 --> 43:30:905
F, which is F squared and we took W to be the set of all vectors A1, A2 such that uh A1 was equal to uh C2

364
43:30:905 --> 43:39:935
where C is in F.

365
43:39:935 --> 43:43:305
That would form a space.

366
43:43:305 --> 43:48:925
You can check that. Yeah. closed. Yeah, I'm sorry.

367
43:48:925 --> 43:56:485
Okay? So you just preserve all the properties and you stay in the subset.

368
43:56:485 --> 44:02:495
So for groups, the property was addition and inversion and the identity, you have to have all that.

369
44:02:495 --> 44:09:975
And you also have to have this property of stable under multiplication.

370
44:09:975 --> 44:15:195
All right. Another thing we had for groups was the notion of a homomorphism. What's the notion of a homomorphism?

371
44:15:195 --> 44:18:885
Yes. What's the notion of a homomorphism?

372
44:18:885 --> 44:24:025
or a linear transformation in the old

373
44:24:025 --> 44:27:765
It's a homomorphism provided,

374
44:27:765 --> 44:39:075
First of all, it's a group homomorphism. T of V plus W is T of V plus T of W. Group home.

375
44:39:075 --> 44:48:765
takes the additive identity to the additive identity, takes inverses to inverses and it commutes with scalar multiplication.

376
44:48:765 --> 44:56:425
where this scalar multiplication takes place in V and this scalar multiplication takes place in W.

377
44:56:425 --> 44:59:235
So, just like a group homomorphism.

378
44:59:235 --> 45:01:465
Okay?

379
45:01:465 --> 45:10:585
If you have a if it's a group if it's a linear transformation which is bijective, we say it's an isomorphism, just like we did for groups.

380
45:10:585 --> 45:17:865
homomorphism is equal to an isomorphism.

381
45:17:865 --> 45:31:005
Moreover, we find that the kernel of T, which are the subgroup of vectors such that T of V is equal to zero is a space

382
45:31:005 --> 45:39:595
of V. That's because if you take T of CV, it's C of T of V.

383
45:39:595 --> 45:49:885
And it's we know it's a subgroup because of group theory. But we have to check it's stable under scalar multiplication.

384
45:49:885 --> 46:01:305
If you take this, you get C * T of V, which is C times the zero vector, and anything times the zero vector is the zero vector.

385
46:01:305 --> 46:06:085
This is the zero vector in W, sorry. Okay?

386
46:06:085 --> 46:19:485
So the kernel and the image of T which are all things of the form T of V inside of W is a space of W.

387
46:19:485 --> 46:30:085
So once I have a homomorphism that preserves scalar multiplication, it's kernel and its image are spaces. One more thing and I'll take a question. Finally, we might as well keep pushing our group theory.

388
46:30:085 --> 46:40:535
Why don't we define uh if I have a space W in V, I can define the quotient space V mod W,

389
46:40:535 --> 46:52:435
the set of cosets of W and V, which is an Abelian group, you check that that has a scalar multiplication.

390
46:52:435 --> 47:01:115
has the structure of a vector space over F.

391
47:01:115 --> 47:14:845
And the natural map, which is a group homomorphism from V to V mod W is a linear transformation with kernel W.

392
47:14:845 --> 47:24:235
So all of our notions from group theory, and here you don't even have to worry about normal subgroup because the group involved is an Abelian group. All our notions from group theory go over into the theory of vector spaces.

393
47:24:235 --> 47:37:355
Once we assume the additional things that the subgroup is stable under scalar multiplication or that the group homomorphism commutes with scalar multiplication.

394
47:37:355 --> 47:48:185
So in some sense by doing vector spaces, you had already done a lot of the theory of Abelian groups, but you had thrown in this extra scalar multiplication that you didn't really need.

395
47:48:185 --> 47:49:935
Now we need it. Okay.

396
47:49:935 --> 47:54:955
So this is uh I should point out that next time you should read section 3.3

397
47:54:955 --> 47:59:845
and the homework. So you should read

398
47:59:845 --> 50:05:005
3.3 for Friday. We're going to get into some more serious linear algebra.

399
50:05:005 --> 50:09:865
Today it's just definitions. And you're going to do exercises

400
50:09:865 --> 50:30:125
3.1.1, 3.1.5, 3.2.1, 3.2.7, 3.2.15.

401
50:30:125 --> 50:34:965
And I promise you this will get a lot more interesting once we get along. Yes.

402
50:34:965 --> 50:37:965
Let take I'll take the questions. First, this question.

403
50:37:965 --> 50:42:745
Oh, always. Yeah yeah yeah. I I'm sorry.

404
50:42:745 --> 50:54:025
Thank you. Um, when one does vector spaces, it's always in the context of a fixed field. There's one field fixed once and for all. So in other words, this wouldn't make any sense.

405
50:54:025 --> 51:00:345
If if you had scalars on W that were different than scalars on V. So the field is fixed once and for all.

406
51:00:345 --> 51:04:955
Complex numbers or Z mod 2 or something like that. But the beautiful thing is

407
51:04:955 --> 51:10:025
that much of the theory of vector spaces is independent of what field you're over. That's what we're going to develop in this chapter.

408
51:10:025 --> 51:14:305
What can we say if we don't even know what F is? Liz.

409
51:14:305 --> 51:26:655
Where is Peter?

410
51:26:655 --> 51:28:505
Okay.

411
51:28:505 --> 51:32:775
We'll figure out a way to get them back to you.

412
51:32:775 --> 51:38:275
Is someone doing office hour if someone doing a section on Thursday?

413
51:38:275 --> 51:42:765
Okay, he'll bring them to the section Thursday if you don't get them today.
