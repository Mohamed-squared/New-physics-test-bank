1
00:00:12,408 --> 00:00:13,878
Alright, let's get started.

2
00:00:14,678 --> 00:00:18,448
So, I'm first going to just go through a review of what we've done so far.

3
00:00:18,448 --> 00:00:26,288
What's the story so far? Well,

4
00:00:27,808 --> 00:00:32,098
the first sort of theme that we've treated is that groups are everywhere.

5
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:38,208
We've defined these things abstractly, but really, they're very, very concrete.

6
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:45,668
If you're ever trying to figure out what should be true in general of a group, you have a lot of great examples to look at to test your ideas on.

7
00:00:45,668 --> 00:00:50,118
So for instance, one of our first examples was GLNR.

8
00:00:50,738 --> 00:00:55,028
Another example we saw was the symmetric group on N letters.

9
00:00:55,848 --> 00:01:01,468
And a third example we saw was the um uh group of integers under addition.

10
00:01:01,468 --> 00:01:06,908
So, when I just write Z, I really mean integers with addition.

11
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:20,618
And another of the themes that that we hinted at, but haven't treated in detail so far is that these things uh arise as the structure preserving bijections of something.

12
00:01:21,188 --> 00:01:34,348
So, what are the structure preserving things here? Well, this is the structure preserving bijections for Rn with its linear structure.

13
00:01:35,218 --> 00:01:47,778
This is just the uh the set of structure preserving uh bijections on a set of n elements with just its set structure, no additional structure.

14
00:01:48,848 --> 00:01:53,338
And Z, there are a lot of ways of sort of realizing Z as the symmetries of something.

15
00:01:53,618 --> 00:01:57,838
So another sort of thing that we'll be talking about is symmetries of geometric objects.

16
00:01:57,838 --> 00:02:11,028
So, this is just a hint at something that I'm not going to treat in detail now, but which will be a recurring theme. If I take um the sort of infinite um directed graph

17
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:24,258
where I have just uh a series of vertices, an infinite number of vertices extending out in both directions and I just have directed arrows, then the symmetries of this thing, well, all I can do is shift it by a certain amount.

18
00:02:25,608 --> 00:02:27,808
Again, we'll treat that in greater detail later.

19
00:02:28,728 --> 00:02:37,018
Another theme we've discussed is that um given a group, there are a whole bunch of other groups that sort of come out of that group.

20
00:02:37,018 --> 00:02:47,648
Um, so making new groups out of old.

21
00:02:48,078 --> 00:02:54,458
And you should really think of this as being a very familiar sort of procedure. You've seen this sort of thing in great detail in linear algebra.

22
00:02:54,668 --> 00:03:02,058
You've seen subspaces of a given vector space and that's the sort of thing that, you know, we saw with subgroups being part of a group.

23
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:11,648
Um, we we saw things like um the cyclic subgroup generated by an element. Well, that's sort of like having the vector space generated by a single vector.

24
00:03:12,088 --> 00:03:22,128
Um, and there'll be a few other things that we'll see later in the course like products of spaces corresponding or being analogous to products of groups.

25
00:03:22,488 --> 00:03:33,848
And then finally, um something that I'll start talking about today. We know that um stuff like Ho Rn Rn has a vector space structure on it.

26
00:03:34,228 --> 00:03:45,408
Well, likewise, the uh given a group, the set of morphisms between G and itself that are bijective form a group.

27
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:55,568
And so we have a lot of analogy analogies and whenever you want to think about what's going on here, you can often think back, you can often use a lot of your intuitions from linear algebra.

28
00:03:56,888 --> 00:04:03,778
A third theme that we've looked at,

29
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:11,798
is that in some cases you can actually classify the subgroups of a given group.

30
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:18,208
So last time we considered the subgroups of Z.

31
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:35,358
Now, the argument we used to show that um every subgroup of Z is of the form BZ looked innocuous, but it's actually a very significant argument. Again, it's something that's going to come back to Honda, so it's a very good idea to familiarize yourself well with that argument.

32
00:04:35,938 --> 00:04:45,398
Um, just recall that basically what we did is we took a subgroup, we said, well, if it's non zero, then there must be some smallest positive integer in it.

33
00:04:45,878 --> 00:04:57,548
And then we showed using the Euclidean algorithm that every element of the group must be a form uh of the form uh an integer times that smallest positive integer.

34
00:04:57,548 --> 00:05:07,988
in the subgroup. So, um in general though, it's very, very difficult to study the subgroup structure of a given group, but it's also very, very important.

35
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:16,288
Um, then another thing that we looked at was

36
00:05:17,808 --> 00:05:21,928
particular cyclic subgroups. So I'll just refresh your memory on that.

37
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:30,618
So if I have a group and I have an element of that group, I can consider the set of all powers of that element and that forms a subgroup.

38
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:42,428
So, here are a couple of examples. If I take in GLNR, the element 1101,

39
00:05:43,568 --> 00:05:47,988
then sorry, GL2R, thank you very much. N is 2.

40
00:05:48,258 --> 00:05:59,488
Um, the cyclic subgroup generated by this thing, well, it's not hard to see that the powers of this thing all look like 1 N 0 1.

41
00:05:59,988 --> 00:06:02,818
Uh, this you can prove usually by induction for instance.

42
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:08,068
Um, people who aren't familiar with mathematical induction maybe should see me after class.

43
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,578
Um, so this is ranging over all integers.

44
00:06:13,878 --> 00:06:16,618
So these are these are a lot of the sorts of themes we've seen so far.

45
00:06:16,618 --> 00:06:28,528
And and so so when when you have infinitely many elements in the uh in the cyclic subgroup generated by a given element, you say that that element has infinite order.

46
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:49,088
Of course, quite often, uh elements will not have infinite order. Quite often, there will be just fintely many distinct powers of something. For instance, if I just take again in GL2R, um minus the identity matrix, then this thing has order two.

47
00:06:51,648 --> 00:06:53,998
I square it and I get the identity matrix.

48
00:06:57,148 --> 00:06:57,808
Sorry?

49
00:06:58,258 --> 00:07:07,878
Okay.

50
00:07:08,578 --> 00:07:13,808
So the first new theme that we're going to talk about today is that of isomorphism.

51
00:07:14,008 --> 00:07:24,838
So let's try a very sort of simple way of of starting to understand isomorphism.

52
00:07:25,108 --> 00:07:28,368
Um, so let's consider a couple of different groups.

53
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:37,978
So the first group, let's consider, call it g1, we'll make this plus or minus one plus or minus I.

54
00:07:38,218 --> 00:07:51,518
viewed as uh a subgroup of C star, which is notation for the non-zero complex numbers equipped with multiplication as the group operation.

55
00:07:54,218 --> 00:08:06,518
So it's just a very simple thing. Um, I mean this is just the powers of I square root of -1 K running through K uh 0 through 3.

56
00:08:07,768 --> 00:08:25,358
Another group, we'll consider is the cyclic subgroup of S4 symmetric group on four letters generated by

57
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,868
something I'll call row.

58
00:08:33,978 --> 00:08:46,588
And well, here's a way of describing what it does. It sort of cycles the things around. It cycles them. So one goes to two, two goes to three, three goes to four, four goes to one.

59
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:57,918
In a shorthand we'll be introducing uh eventually, this might be written 1, two, three, four. Now you don't have to worry about that, but it's an easy way of just sort of coding what this permutation is.

60
00:08:59,378 --> 00:09:10,558
Um and it's not hard to see that for instance, well, row squared is certainly not either the identity or row.

61
00:09:10,558 --> 00:09:25,318
You can see that because if you evaluate uh row composed with itself, um well, one will go to two, two will go to three. So row squared takes one to three. Um and certainly neither the identity nor row do that.

62
00:09:25,788 --> 00:09:43,068
Likewise, row cubed is not one of E row row squared. by the same sort of argument or just using what we've established already and um inverting. I mean if if row cube equal row squared then for instance row would equal E, which isn't true.

63
00:09:43,818 --> 00:10:01,248
Um, but because these things are just being cycled around, it's not hard to see that one will end up back at one after composing this permutation with itself four times and likewise for two, three and four. So this is just the identity.

64
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:25,618
Um, so put another way, the multiplication table for this thing, E row, row squared, row cubed just looks like E row, row squared, row cubed, then shift this row, row squared, row cubed E, row squared, row cubed E row, row cubed E row row squared.

65
00:10:26,298 --> 00:10:28,648
That follows immediately from this.

66
00:10:29,518 --> 00:10:34,698
But that's exactly the same thing as the multiplication table for I.

67
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:44,598
So in some sense, these are really the same group. They just have the same multiplication table, but they're relabelings of each other.

68
00:10:46,538 --> 00:10:52,848
Is that fairly clear or does anybody not see that?

69
00:10:54,258 --> 00:10:55,738
I guess I don't see. Okay, sure.

70
00:10:56,518 --> 00:11:02,158
So I has the property that its fourth power is one.

71
01:11:03,058 --> 01:12,428
But all the powers in between

72
01:12,838 --> 01:19,088
uh that and, you know, this fourth power are not any of the previous things. So for instance,

73
01:19,088 --> 01:24,558
I is not I squared is not it's minus one. It's not the same thing as one or I. Um I cube is minus I, that's not one

74
01:24,558 --> 01:32,618
minus one or I. Um and so again, by the same sort of thing, when you multiply the things around, it just sort of circulates them.

75
01:35,528 --> 01:42,158
So call this thing G2.

76
01:45,958 --> 01:52,428
The idea is that G1 and G2 have the same multiplication table,

77
01:55,448 --> 02:06,638
but with a relabeling.

78
02:08,118 --> 02:16,178
So this idea of relabeling multiplication tables gets formalized in algebra under the name isomorphism.

79
02:16,838 --> 02:24,568
So I'll write down a definition now.

80
02:26,018 --> 02:27,718
isomorphism.

81
02:28,308 --> 02:31,578
And isomorphism is a map

82
02:33,188 --> 02:41,548
between two groups which is bijective and such that

83
02:43,448 --> 02:46,018
it preserves the multiplication operation.

84
02:46,338 --> 02:52,968
So f of X * Y is f of X * f of Y.

85
02:54,068 --> 03:03,618
Where of course, over here, this is the multiplication in G1 and this is the multiplication in G2.

86
03:06,238 --> 03:12,828
So this is the same sort of idea. You're just F is what's telling you how to relabel the things.

87
03:13,668 --> 03:24,838
And um the idea that the multiplication table is preserved is just saying that uh f ofx * Y is the same thing as f ofx * f of y.

88
03:25,318 --> 03:28,638
So, here's another example.

89
03:30,338 --> 03:32,168
So in this case what's the?

90
03:32,538 --> 03:39,168
So in this case, the isomorphism is given explicitly by sending powers of I, so say I to the Kth power

91
03:40,678 --> 03:42,108
So explicitly,

92
03:54,258 --> 03:56,068
in our case,

93
03:57,018 --> 04:02,688
I send the Kth power of I to the Kth power of row.

94
04:03,438 --> 04:11,648
So one gets sent to the identity, uh I gets sent to row, I squared gets sent to row squared, I cube gets sent to row cubed.

95
04:12,438 --> 04:14,118
Does that mean f of I to the K?

96
04:14,398 --> 04:14,938
Yeah, so

97
04:15,168 --> 04:20,318
F of I to the K equals row to the K.

98
04:31,338 --> 04:32,748
gives us an nice.

99
04:42,358 --> 04:48,048
And a more general fact, which is a very good exercise,

100
04:48,818 --> 04:58,058
which I believe is included in the exercises for today, which I'll put up on the board uh at the end of class, is the following. So, um

101
04:59,748 --> 05:05,968
I'll write it as a fact now, and I'll leave part of the thing unproved and the exercise will be to fill in the gap.

102
05:06,328 --> 05:12,168
So, I'm going to use some words and then I'll explain exactly what I mean by them.

103
05:12,168 --> 05:26,368
So every cyclic group of order n or every two cyclic groups of order n

104
05:27,538 --> 05:29,578
are isomorphic.

105
05:30,318 --> 05:37,638
Um so definitions.

106
05:37,958 --> 05:55,368
A cyclic group is just a group um such that there is some element in it which generates the entire group.

107
05:58,888 --> 06:04,398
And isomorphic,

108
06:05,498 --> 06:10,858
well we say g1 and g2 are isomorphic

109
06:21,808 --> 06:31,018
if there is an isomorphism between them.

110
06:32,988 --> 06:44,518
And we'll see shortly that if there's an isomorphism going one way, there's certainly one going the other way and this turns out to be a good equivalence relation, but we'll see that later.

111
06:45,158 --> 07:07,558
But how do we see that? Well, um in brief, and again, you fill this, you finish this off in the uh uh assignment in the problem set. If I have g1, g2 and they're both cyclic of order N, and I have elements X1 and X2 that generate,

112
07:09,318 --> 07:21,968
then the map F from g1 to g2 taking the Kth power of X1 to the Kth power of X2,

113
07:22,858 --> 07:30,198
you can show is a well-defined bijection.

114
07:31,678 --> 07:36,848
Specifically because X1 and X2 have the same order, and that's what the exercise is about.

115
07:39,848 --> 07:54,538
And the preservation of multiplication property is fairly straightforward. That follows just from the fact that if I have X1 to the n times X2 to the M, so F X1 to the n X2 to the M,

116
07:59,608 --> 08:08,818
Well, that's F X1 to the n + M, that's X2 to the n + M, and that's X2 to the n times X2 to the M.

117
08:08,818 --> 08:16,718
So really all there is to check is that this thing is a well-defined bijection.

118
08:18,448 --> 08:24,318
Now, um, let's talk about something which isn't cyclic. Oh, yeah.

119
08:24,878 --> 08:27,618
Is there a cyclic group of order n for every n?

120
08:27,618 --> 08:34,668
It turns out there is one, and it's not hard to construct one inside of SN by just taking the cycle.

121
08:34,668 --> 08:40,048
So in SN, so the question is about is there is there always a cyclic group of order n?

122
08:40,048 --> 08:53,078
Well, in SN, the cycle, the uh the permutation taking 1 to two, two to three, etcetera on down n - 1 to n, and then n back to one,

123
08:53,968 --> 09:01,508
it's not hard to show has order n and uh so the group generated by that is a cyclic group of order n. Yes, your question.

124
09:02,578 --> 09:03,188
Can you call please?

125
09:03,448 --> 09:04,318
Absolutely.

126
09:08,928 --> 09:09,538
Yeah.

127
09:09,748 --> 09:14,888
Um in that second to the bottom board can you write F of X1 to the N times X1 to the M?

128
09:16,038 --> 09:17,658
Yeah, this is X1.

129
09:18,318 --> 09:18,888
Absolutely.

130
09:27,358 --> 09:28,568
Any other questions?

131
09:34,518 --> 09:34,828
Yeah.

132
09:34,998 --> 09:39,658
on the SN thing that you just put up there, Mhm. That was to show what exactly?

133
09:39,818 --> 09:44,028
So in SN, there's certainly a permutation that looks like this.

134
09:44,028 --> 09:45,798
This is permutation.

135
09:47,448 --> 09:50,478
And um call it sigma sub n.

136
09:51,288 --> 09:56,838
And the question was, is there always a cyclic group of order n?

137
09:57,418 --> 10:00,978
And so it turns out there is because if I take this permutation in SN,

138
10:03,758 --> 10:19,858
and I consider the cyclic subgroup generate of SN generated by this sigma N, then this thing has order N.

139
10:25,698 --> 10:27,038
Okay, is everyone caught up?

140
10:29,988 --> 10:30,848
Okay, great.

141
10:31,168 --> 10:35,188
So, um, let's look at a different kind of example.

142
10:35,848 --> 10:38,338
Um,

143
10:40,438 --> 10:41,518
example.

144
10:45,978 --> 10:54,218
Well, consider the real numbers under addition

145
10:55,288 --> 11:04,488
and the positive real numbers, the strictly positive real numbers under multiplication.

146
11:06,568 --> 11:12,568
A priori, just looking at these things, you wouldn't necessarily expect that they'd be isomorphic.

147
11:13,418 --> 11:21,768
So

148
11:21,768 --> 11:25,568
But does anybody see something that witnesses an isomorphism? Yeah.

149
11:26,818 --> 11:31,688
Absolutely. So,

150
11:32,598 --> 11:34,958
or putting it another way,

151
11:35,668 --> 11:42,458
Um, what you can do is take F from, so here's G1, here's G2.

152
11:42,988 --> 11:49,488
F from g1 to g2 defined it by f ofx is E to the X.

153
11:51,468 --> 11:58,638
Well, we know because of the existence of the logarithm, this is certainly a bijection has the right image and everything.

154
11:59,388 --> 12:09,778
And also, we know just by basic math that E to the X + Y is E to the X * E to the Y.

155
12:10,878 --> 12:15,348
So it preserves the group structure, it preserves the multiplication table.

156
12:17,968 --> 12:24,448
So this is an example of a pair of isomorphic groups that are not finite and are not cyclic.

157
12:30,598 --> 12:37,858
Okay, another example, returning to finite groups, but something which is not cyclic.

158
12:38,188 --> 12:43,628
And this is a very useful group to sort of a very, very small but useful group to test things out on.

159
12:44,978 --> 12:48,848
It's called the Klein four group and I'll give you two ways of writing it.

160
12:50,178 --> 12:57,508
Klein four group.

161
12:58,018 --> 13:05,578
So the first way I'll write it is um as a subset of S4.

162
13:05,578 --> 13:13,418
So, two ways to write it.

163
13:13,828 --> 13:17,328
So the first one, uh, call it G1.

164
13:18,038 --> 13:25,708
Um, I have just the identity E.

165
13:26,338 --> 13:39,968
I'll take something uh I guess I'll call um tau1 and I'll define it as follows. It'll take one to two and two back to one.

166
13:43,368 --> 13:45,708
It'll also exchange three and four.

167
13:47,988 --> 13:52,628
Tau 2, I'll take to be um something that exchanges

168
13:54,758 --> 13:58,378
one and three and two and four.

169
13:58,568 --> 14:03,968
So one goes to three, three goes to one, two goes to four, four goes to two. Is that clear?

170
14:07,318 --> 14:13,928
And the final element I'll take is Tau 1 Tau 2.

171
14:15,018 --> 14:28,248
And just by tracing through these things. So first I look at what Tau 2 goes to one does to one say. So Tau 2 takes one to three and then Tau 1 takes three to four.

172
14:28,698 --> 14:31,088
So one goes to four.

173
14:34,518 --> 14:43,308
And if I just keep on computing these things this way, I find that four goes back to one, two goes to three, three goes to two.

174
14:44,858 --> 14:57,798
But it's also easy to verify that if I reverse the order, if I take tau1, if I apply tau1 to something and then tau2 to the result of that, then I get exactly the same thing.

175
15:02,428 --> 15:13,688
So, just a sort of linguistic point here, we say that these things commute, tau1 and tau2 commute because tau1 tau2 equals tau2 tau1.

176
15:19,768 --> 15:26,658
So, what is the group structure here? Well, what's Tau 1 squared?

177
15:29,868 --> 15:31,328
It's the identity.

178
15:31,688 --> 15:32,818
What's Tau 2 squared?

179
15:34,148 --> 15:36,728
What's Tau 1 Tau 2 squared?

180
15:37,048 --> 15:37,678
Exactly.

181
15:37,778 --> 15:45,308
So the group structure is very, very simple. Each of these things if we multiply by itself, you get E.

182
15:46,038 --> 15:57,348
Obviously, if you take E by any of these things, you get whatever you multiplied by back. And if I multiply tau1 by tau 2, I get tau1 tau 2 or tau 2 by tau1, I get the same thing.

183
15:57,638 --> 16:02,378
What about if I multiply tau1 by tau1 tau 2?

184
16:02,378 --> 16:07,068
Exactly. So if I take any of these things of order two and I multiply them by each other, I get the third.

185
16:07,638 --> 16:15,298
So here's another way of writing the group.

186
16:17,498 --> 16:29,758
I could just write it as the set of matrices, so in GL2R say, I could just write it as the set of matrices, well, identity matrix.

187
16:33,328 --> 16:39,998
Where I just change the entries here to to minus ones.

188
16:40,498 --> 16:49,948
So certainly these have um the same relevant property.

189
16:49,948 --> 16:59,888
Um, if I multiply any of these things by themselves, I get the identity matrix back. And if I multiply any two of the things which have negative entries, then I get the third of the things that have negative entries.

190
17:01,738 --> 17:13,218
So again, you know, they have the same multiplication table and there's a nice direct bijection. I can for instance have the bijection F

191
17:13,218 --> 17:25,998
take E to the identity, Tau 1 to this, Tau 2 to this, and Tau 1 Tau 2 to this.

192
17:29,238 --> 17:30,828
Okay, great.

193
17:31,298 --> 17:31,918
Yes.

194
17:32,588 --> 17:35,388
Why do you need to define the four elements of the group? I mean that's just given the first three where the fourth

195
17:37,218 --> 17:38,888
have to be in there. Absolutely. I could have said

196
17:39,188 --> 17:42,778
the group generated by tau1 tau 2.

197
17:43,258 --> 17:47,088
But if I want to list all the elements in the group, then I better include tau1 tau 2.

198
17:47,438 --> 17:48,168
So the question was,

199
17:48,478 --> 17:53,978
did uh uh do I really need to include Tau 1 Tau 2 in this list?

200
17:54,388 --> 17:55,998
Well, yes and no.

201
17:56,368 --> 18:02,068
If I wanted to say, you know, just consider the group, the smallest group that contains Tau 1 and Tau 2,

202
18:02,608 --> 18:04,958
Well, I could have just said Tau 1 Tau 2.

203
18:05,428 --> 18:13,058
But if I want to write out the entire group explicitly, all of the elements, then I need to include Tau 1 Tau 2 and the identity.

204
18:13,058 --> 18:14,258
So,

205
18:24,918 --> 18:26,208
Okay, so non example.

206
18:31,888 --> 18:39,638
So the client group. So I say the, and this is a confusion that that that you you often make or sort of uh

207
18:42,498 --> 18:50,688
uh a shorthand that you often make in algebra and that is that if you have a couple of groups that are isomorphic, you often talk about them as if they're the same group.

208
18:50,898 --> 18:59,598
So although we have two different ways of concretely realizing the client four group, because they're isomorphic, we talk about it as if there's just the client four group.

209
19:00,718 --> 19:14,658
So is the client four group isomorphic to that cyclic group we started with?

210
19:15,908 --> 19:16,458
question? Yes.

211
19:17,868 --> 19:18,488
Is there a simple for the client group?

212
19:18,678 --> 19:20,688
Pardon me? Is there a simple for the client group? Um,

213
19:21,618 --> 19:31,068
I mean it's not very sta- the question is is there a symbol for the client group? Different texts will often have different short hands for it before there's a more sophisticated notion introduced.

214
19:31,608 --> 19:43,338
I mean, but yeah, I mean, later on we'll see that there's a a sort of simpler way of writing in terms of things which do have a notation. Um, so just as a preview, it's a product of two cyclic groups of order two.

215
19:46,158 --> 19:47,198
Yes, Peter.

216
19:49,358 --> 19:58,118
I think Artin might is is Artin might use the the notation V for the client four group. So, but if you look in other texts, I'm not sure that it'll have the same notation.

217
19:58,118 --> 19:59,998
But yeah, Artin might use that notation.

218
20:01,888 --> 20:04,648
But so, is this are these things isomorphic?

219
20:05,398 --> 20:05,838
No.

220
20:05,998 --> 20:08,188
What's an easy way of seeing that they're not isomorphic?

221
20:08,848 --> 20:09,368
Yeah.

222
20:12,688 --> 20:13,588
Exactly.

223
20:13,588 --> 20:21,508
It has So an easy way of seeing this is that I has order four, whereas the client group only has elements of maximal order two.

224
20:21,988 --> 20:27,938
So here are some very, very simple ways um of checking whether things are isomorphic.

225
20:27,938 --> 20:46,338
So no, um uh the former doesn't have elements of order four, whereas this does has two of them, I and minus I.

226
20:49,968 --> 20:55,558
Okay.

227
20:56,688 --> 20:57,288
Um,

228
20:57,768 --> 21:05,388
so here are some here are some easy ways of of you know, first checking whether two groups are isomorphic or not. Obviously the these won't work in all cases.

229
21:05,388 --> 21:07,238
But um

230
21:11,418 --> 21:29,398
some properties to test whether groups are isomorphic.

231
21:31,158 --> 21:36,158
The first one I'll list is that they have the same order.

232
21:36,468 --> 21:42,118
If they're finite groups or infinite groups, they'd better have the same cardinality because there's a bijection between them.

233
21:43,618 --> 21:55,988
A second thing they'd better have in common is that if one is a billion, the other had better be a billion. and vice versa.

234
21:56,818 --> 22:20,778
And the third quick thing that you can easily check in a lot of cases is that G1 and G2 uh had better have the same number of elements of every order.

235
22:24,748 --> 22:25,338
Yes.

236
22:25,868 --> 22:28,958
Is cardinality of the group just the number of elements in it?

237
22:29,088 --> 22:30,058
That's yeah,

238
22:30,058 --> 22:33,478
cardinality is a synonym for number of elements.

239
22:33,758 --> 22:35,978
And there's another term we use, the order of a group.

240
22:36,358 --> 22:49,288
So there there there often as in as in Yeah, you can you can use them essentially interchangeably, although the term order has different meanings in other context. So order is something that's more specific to the language of groups.

241
22:49,558 --> 22:54,188
But as in any sort of language, yeah, there there are often synonyms and there there's a lot of redundancy.

242
23:01,778 --> 23:02,568
Okay.

243
23:02,948 --> 23:14,068
So we mentioned earlier that given any group G, we can construct another group out of it by taking its symmetries.

244
23:14,498 --> 23:21,858
In other words, taking bijections between the group and itself that preserve the structure on a group.

245
23:22,338 --> 23:25,688
What's a name for this that we've come up with so far?

246
23:28,238 --> 23:28,948
automorphism?

247
23:29,188 --> 23:35,138
Exactly. So well, so last time we saw the term automorphism, but today we used the term isomorphism.

248
23:35,138 --> 23:38,988
So an isomorphism between a group and itself is called an automorphism.

249
23:39,468 --> 23:44,628
So here's another example or here's another sort of uh construction.

250
23:44,628 --> 23:53,828
So given G, we can construct the set

251
23:56,408 --> 23:57,938
denoted odd G.

252
23:57,938 --> 24:01,908
So these are called automorphisms,

253
24:02,938 --> 24:16,398
which is just a shorthand for isomorphisms between the group and itself.

254
24:19,408 --> 24:42,568
So this is the set um well, as I said, of isomorphisms from G to G, but in the sort of impressionistic language we were using earlier, this is the symmetries of G or the structure preserving maps of G.

255
24:43,538 --> 24:51,708
structure preserving bijections.

256
24:52,868 --> 24:53,938
Any questions?

257
24:55,158 --> 24:56,118
Okay.

258
24:56,118 --> 25:01,898
So there's something that we haven't verified that we really ought to verify.

259
25:02,798 --> 25:09,008
So I called this a group. This is a little problematic.

260
25:09,008 --> 25:21,368
I mean, we know certainly that composites of um isomorphisms are isomorphisms because certainly the the composite will still be a bijection and uh if you have say F and g isomorphisms then

261
25:25,528 --> 25:36,688
F of G FG XY is F of g of X g of Y which is FG X FGY.

262
25:38,908 --> 25:45,988
And the identity is certainly there. We have just the usual identity map from G to itself and that's certainly an isomorphism.

263
25:46,598 --> 25:53,918
But we're missing something and that is that inverses are still automorphisms.

264
25:54,278 --> 25:57,508
And that's easy to verify, but it's something you certainly need to verify.

265
25:58,358 --> 26:08,568
And um I'll give as an exercise. It's extremely easy, but it's I'll list it as one of the exercises to prove that this thing is a group.

266
26:08,848 --> 26:38,158
So the thing you need to verify, the last remaining thing to verify um exercise in problem set show that the inverse of an iso uh of an automorphism is an automorphism.

267
26:38,778 --> 26:42,438
Or more generally that the inverse of an isomorphism is an isomorphism.

268
26:42,438 --> 26:48,628
This isn't hard to see, uh but it's worth verifying to make sure that you're comfortable with the language.

269
26:51,938 --> 26:58,148
So it's going to be one of the problems I list amongst the uh um things from Artin.

270
27:02,268 --> 27:04,878
Okay. Um,

271
27:09,008 --> 27:11,708
let's move along to something a little different.

272
27:12,228 --> 27:21,708
So, so far we we've talked about bijections which preserve the structure of a group, that preserve the multiplication operation.

273
27:22,748 --> 27:27,668
But I'm going to introduce a sort of generalization of this idea. things called homomorphisms.

274
27:30,868 --> 27:31,688
So for instance,

275
27:32,718 --> 27:42,208
the determinant map from say GLNR to R star,

276
27:42,708 --> 27:51,908
which again, per our previous notation is the non-zero elements of R with multiplication as the group operation.

277
27:53,008 --> 28:08,348
Well, it's certainly a well-defined map and we know um that the determinant of AB is the determinant of A times the determinant of B by basic linear algebra.

278
28:08,868 --> 28:10,638
Is this thing an isomorphism?

279
28:11,998 --> 28:12,568
No.

280
28:12,888 --> 28:15,078
What's an easy way of seeing that it's not an isomorphism?

281
28:17,128 --> 28:17,688
Sorry?

282
28:18,748 --> 28:19,628
Yeah, go ahead.

283
28:19,928 --> 28:23,038
It's not one to one for example.

284
28:23,708 --> 28:37,248
Um well, so yeah, I mean it's there are a lot of easy ways of seeing that that in fact GLN and R star aren't even can't possibly be isomorphic. One of them being for instance that

285
28:37,248 --> 28:38,268
this is a billion and this is not.

286
28:38,268 --> 28:45,598
So uh certainly debt is not one to one and in fact there can't be any isomorphism between GLNR and R star.

287
28:47,218 --> 28:50,078
Um but nonetheless it does preserve the group structure.

288
28:50,148 --> 28:51,708
There can be no bijection.

289
28:52,558 --> 28:59,068
There can be bijections. In fact, these two have the same cardinality, but you you can never show that they have the same group structure.

290
28:59,068 --> 29:00,408
So the question was, could there be bijections?

291
29:00,658 --> 29:09,288
Yes, there certainly can be bijections, but they'll never be uh they'll never be isomorphic as groups.

292
29:09,838 --> 29:10,808
Yeah. Okay.

293
29:11,868 --> 29:24,018
Okay.

294
29:24,458 --> 29:34,888
So the formalization of this idea where you have some sort of map and it preserves the group structure, but you don't make any sort of assumption that the thing is bijective.

295
29:35,458 --> 29:37,748
That's this idea of homomorphism.

296
29:38,228 --> 29:40,568
So,

297
29:40,938 --> 29:45,998
the formalization homomorphisms

298
29:49,738 --> 29:57,838
are maps F between groups such that

299
29:59,808 --> 3:06,008
f of X * Y is f of X * f of Y.

300
3:09,278 --> 3:10,388
Okay.

301
3:10,808 --> 3:16,218
And so can people give me examples of homomorphisms?

302
3:18,188 --> 3:18,818
Yes, go ahead.

303
3:20,138 --> 3:22,238
Exactly.

304
3:22,778 --> 3:31,108
Every isomorphism is a homomorphism.

305
3:33,678 --> 3:40,618
Suppose I have a pair of groups, g1, g2. Is there necessarily a homomorphism between them?

306
3:44,218 --> 3:44,628
Does anybody have any ideas?

307
3:45,948 --> 3:47,268
Yeah, go ahead.

308
3:47,788 --> 3:52,858
No, because they may not have the same order.

309
3:53,378 --> 4:00,228
Well, that would be a problem if I were asking is there always an isomorphism between groups, but homomorphisms, we don't know preserve

310
4:01,558 --> 4:03,718
things like the order of a group.

311
4:03,858 --> 4:06,098
How about mapping everything to the identity?

312
4:06,348 --> 4:07,138
Absolutely.

313
4:07,298 --> 4:11,138
So there's always a trivial homomorphism between any two groups.

314
4:12,968 --> 4:19,268
trivial homomorphism. So between g1, g2,

315
4:20,198 --> 4:27,878
and that's defined by just taking f ofx to the identity element of g2.

316
4:28,348 --> 4:38,918
That certainly preserves the group structure because uh f ofx * Y, well, that's automatically E and that's automatically the same thing as f ofx * f of Y because both of those are E.

317
4:41,668 --> 4:49,068
Okay.

318
4:49,788 --> 4:50,858
Another piece of terminology.

319
4:51,698 --> 4:52,568
images.

320
4:53,438 --> 5:01,868
So the notion of image is about seeing a group through the lens of a homomorphism.

321
5:01,868 --> 5:09,948
So suppose I have F going from g1 to g2. So I'll just draw these things as some sort of blobs.

322
5:12,608 --> 5:16,428
Not everything in g2 is necessarily going to be hit by F.

323
5:16,828 --> 5:18,808
But some subset of it will be, certainly.

324
5:20,518 --> 5:22,728
So here's g1, here's g2.

325
5:24,178 --> 5:28,058
And the shaded in part, the part that's hit by G1 is called the image.

326
5:28,408 --> 5:36,228
Now this is a familiar notion. This is from linear algebra. There were a couple of different names. You might have called it image. You probably also called it column space of a matrix.

327
5:37,578 --> 5:49,448
Um in our case, we just call it the image and it's the set of f ofx in g2 as X ranges over g1.

328
5:50,608 --> 5:57,508
And um the uh main professor, Professor Gross will pick up on this next time.

329
5:58,348 --> 6:01,518
Um, are there any questions about what we've done so far?

330
6:04,138 --> 6:06,798
Great. Now I'm going to list the homework exercises.

331
6:11,048 --> 6:12,908
Think about the fact that the image can be sub.

332
6:13,288 --> 6:14,788
You can think about that today.

333
6:14,968 --> 6:16,818
It's it's actually on the problem set.

334
6:17,048 --> 6:23,898
Okay. It'll be posted online as well, but

335
6:27,018 --> 6:34,928
So a couple of these you've seen already in in more or less detail in class today, but it's still a very good idea to work through the details of it.

336
7:10,742 --> 7:14,442
about the fact that the image can be. You can think about that.

337
7:14,932 --> 7:16,862
It's it's actually it's on the problem set.

338
7:17,112 --> 7:20,562
Okay.

339
7:20,962 --> 7:22,012
moment.

340
7:22,342 --> 7:24,292
It'll be posted online as well, but

341
7:26,952 --> 7:35,052
So a couple of these you've seen already in in more or less detail in class today, but it's still a very good idea to work through the details of it.

342
8:13,447 --> 8:14,417
Okay, great.

343
8:14,797 --> 8:16,737
This is due on Monday.

344
8:17,257 --> 8:20,837
So Friday assignments are due on Mondays, etc.

345
8:22,167 --> 8:22,817
Yeah, go ahead.

346
8:23,057 --> 8:24,917
Will there be solutions posted? Yeah, there there will be

347
8:25,187 --> 8:27,587
solutions posted to the assignments.

348
8:29,947 --> 8:30,817
Okay, great.

349
8:31,317 --> 8:31,867
Yeah.

350
8:33,077 --> 8:36,627
When are we going to get homework back from Friday? Oh, yeah. So, uh,

351
8:37,737 --> 8:41,797
the way this is going to work at least for the beginning for the first while is that um you won't necessarily get your

352
8:41,797 --> 8:53,907
homework back on the next lecture uh after you hand it in, but in general, you'll be getting your homework assignments, accumulated homework assignments back on Wednesdays.

353
8:55,977 --> 8:56,807
Okay, great.
