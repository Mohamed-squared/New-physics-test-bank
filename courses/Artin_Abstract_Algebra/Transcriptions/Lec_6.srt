1
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,360
Okay, let's get started now.

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,460
So, what do we want to do in today's lecture?

3
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,420
There are two main goals for today's lecture.

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,210
Oh, okay.

5
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,390
The first goal for today's lecture is umm

6
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,200
Excuse me, could you stop talking in the back, please?

7
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,250
Thank you.

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:01:01,560
uh is to generalize the arithmetic of what I'll call evens and odds.

9
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,010
So what do I mean by that?

10
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:17,780
Well, I mean something that you sort of discover when you're really, really young, is that there's sort of a nice way of computing with evens and odds independently of, you know, the the whole arithmetic of all of the integers.

11
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:29,610
So, what I mean by that is if I denote by zero bar all the even numbers and by one bar all the odd numbers,

12
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,930
and there's a sort of natural addition operation.

13
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:39,980
If I add an even to an even, then I get an even.

14
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:48,570
If I add an odd to an odd, I get an even, but if I add an odd to an even or an even to an odd, then I get something odd.

15
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:55,110
Likewise, there's a sort of multiplication table for even and odds, evens and odds.

16
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:04,360
If I multiply something that's even by something that's odd or even, then I certainly get something that's even.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,720
But if I multiply something odd by something odd, then I get something odd.

18
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:17,540
So there's this whole sort of simple arithmetic that goes on with evens and odds, but you have to ask the question, what's so special about the number two?

19
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,530
Well, the answer is there's nothing special about the number two.

20
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:27,700
And so, one of the things that we're going to talk about today is how to go from two to any N.

21
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:53,080
The second thing I'd like to do is make concrete what we did last time with uh cosets and equivalence relations.

22
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,280
And it's going to turn out that these are really sort of one and the same goal.

23
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,960
Exce- ex- at least when it comes to studying uh subgroups of the integers.

24
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,890
Um so, let's get started on that.

25
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:34,230
So, the main concept that is going to be new in lecture and which was on the reading from last lecture is that of congruence mod n and it's arithmetic.

26
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:45,260
So, let's fix some n a positive integer.

27
00:03:46,830 --> 00:04:02,610
and define on the integers a relation. So, the relation is going to be A is related to B if and only if n divides A - B.

28
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:14,390
Or put another way A - B is in NZ, in the subgroup NZ of the integers,

29
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,370
which is just the set of multiples of n.

30
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,430
So, well, it's not hard to see that this is an equivalence relation.

31
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,800
Why? Well,

32
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:44,290
first of all, it's certainly reflexive. I mean, that just follows from the fact that a - a is zero, which is certainly a multiple of n.

33
00:04:46,490 --> 00:05:00,220
If A is related to B, then certainly B is related to A because what does this mean? Well, a - b is a multiple of n, but then b - a is certainly also multiple of n. So, B is related to A.

34
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:17,670
And finally, if A is related to B and B is related to C, then, well, what do these mean? This means a - b and b - c are in uh NZ, are a multiple of n in other words. And so is their sum then.

35
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,210
And if you add a - b and b - c, you get a - c.

36
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,460
So A is related to C.

37
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,550
So this is definitely an equivalence relation.

38
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:38,500
Now, for notational purposes, it's often not sufficient just to write this relator symbol tle.

39
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:49,090
So, we have another piece of notation.

40
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:56,120
And that is A is congruent to B mod n.

41
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:11,160
So, this is a synonym for A tle B with n made explicit.

42
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:23,030
And the way we say this is A is congruent to B mod n. So this is just a linguistic issue.

43
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:30,120
So, well, what are the equivalence classes?

44
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:37,960
I mean, whenever you have an equivalence relation, one of the first questions you ask is, what is the structure of the equivalence classes?

45
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,020
I mean, this is the sort of thing that we started talking about last time.

46
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,220
Well, so let's write them down.

47
00:06:51,050 --> 00:07:08,110
So, if I have an integer A, then at least for today, we're going to write A overline, A bar to denote the equivalence class

48
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,180
of A.

49
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,900
And um well, what does A bar look like?

50
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:25,610
What's a way of my writing A bar down just as a sort of explicit set? Go ahead.

51
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,720
Okay. Yes.

52
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:35,330
Yes, it's um set of all numbers Z from N Z where Z is Z Z Z Z Z K + A.

53
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,420
Exactly.

54
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:51,430
A bar looks like A + NZ or as you put it, all things of the form A + Kn as K ranges over Z.

55
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,550
These are the same thing.

56
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:04,140
Now, does this look familiar from last time? Did we have another sort of piece of terminology for things of this form? Coset.

57
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,460
Exactly. This is an example of a coset.

58
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:22,050
So, in the language from last time, where we had some subgroup H of some group Z,

59
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:39,040
we had these things that look like AH or perhaps better written A operation H.

60
00:08:39,560 --> 00:09:04,210
But we're working with NZ, the subgroup of Z where the group operation is noted plus. So, this sort of multiplicative notation is not really appropriate. So, what we're really working with is A + H or what is the same A + NZ as the set of cosets of NZ.

61
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,850
The cosets are things of this form.

62
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,420
So these equivalence classes are just cosets.

63
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:28,000
One of the important themes here is that you lose a lot of information when you pass from all of the integers to the cosets, just as you lose a lot of information when you pass from all the integers to evens and odds.

64
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:37,070
So, for instance, if n equals 12.

65
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:59,200
I mean, bear in mind that from the point of view of of just the cosets of 12Z, um two and 26 are indistinguishable or put another way, 2 bar equals 26 bar.

66
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:02,830
Now, here's an observation.

67
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:08,330
We can very explicitly write down all the cosets.

68
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:25,220
There are n distinct cosets of NZ.

69
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,030
And we can write them down completely explicitly.

70
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:37,000
So, we're put another way equivalence classes modulo N.

71
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:41,350
So these are all sort of redundant ways of of saying the same thing, but you'll hear them all.

72
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:46,060
So it's good to sort of just practice hearing them uh each.

73
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:49,210
So, what are they? Well, can somebody list them?

74
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:50,670
Go ahead.

75
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:54,570
Z mod 1 Z Right.

76
01:00:56,310 --> 01:01:05,470
Or in a sort of shorter notation 0 1 two up to n - 1.

77
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:07,580
Why is this?

78
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:16,190
Can anybody give me a quick proof at least that every coset or every uh equivalence class is of this form.

79
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:18,000
Yeah, go ahead.

80
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:22,130
divide by n Exactly.

81
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:26,300
So, this is a matter of taking advantage of the division algorithm.

82
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,300
So, why?

83
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:36,030
Well, at least in one part, it's the division algorithm.

84
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:59,190
If I have some A, then I can write it in the form n Q + R where Q and R are both integers, but moreover, 0 is less than or equal to r is less than n.

85
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:05,540
And then this is just saying that A bar equals R bar.

86
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:10,510
So we certainly have a representative in this range.

87
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:14,060
Moreover, these are all distinct.

88
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:28,090
Because if A bar is the same as B bar and we both have the these things in the range 0 to n - 1, so things that look like this.

89
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:40,490
Well, then the magnitude of the the uh difference between these things is also bounded by 0 and n + 1.

90
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:55,200
And moreover, we know by hypothesis, these are in the same equivalence class. So, b - A and a - b are both divisible by n.

91
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,290
So this thing is in NZ, but the only thing in this range in NZ is zero.

92
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:08,050
So this thing is just zero or what is the same A equals B.

93
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,660
So these things are each distinct.

94
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:18,010
Now, how do we describe this thing?

95
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:35,200
Well, following the notation from last time, you might think, well, we're going to notate uh the equivalence classes of Z modulo N or modulo NZ by Z bar because we had this sort of notation S goes to the set of equivalence classes S bar.

96
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:44,580
This is not such a great notation because you lose which n you're working with. So, the usual notation is Z mod NZ.

97
01:03:48,550 --> 01:04:01,890
notation or set of equivalence classes

98
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:09,830
is um Z mod NZ.

99
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:19,380
or sometimes just shorten to Z mod n or sometimes brackets are put around n.

100
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:22,200
These are all synonymous.

101
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:27,210
So, what next?

102
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:40,530
Well, again, sort of following what we saw last time visavis equivalence relations, there is a natural map from Z to Z mod NZ

103
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:48,560
that takes A to its equivalence class and the the fibers are the equivalence classes themselves.

104
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:56,340
But what we're about to do is put some additional structure on Z mod NZ.

105
01:04:56,990 --> 01:05:02,200
We're going to make this a group and this thing is actually going to become a homomorphism.

106
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:12,440
So, let's start studying how this thing inherits an arithmetic from Z.

107
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:24,520
So, can do arithmetic in Z mod NZ.

108
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:27,360
Um,

109
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:45,490
so how do we define for instance, a sum of two things? Well, we're going to define it, although we should verify that this is well defined by um the equivalence class of A + B.

110
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:57,670
And likewise, we're going to define a multiplication or we define a multiplication by A bar times B bar being AB bar.

111
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:02,600
Now, why is this well defined? Well, it's it's a sort of simple verification.

112
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:11,310
But it's certainly important to check because we do offhand have a lot of different ways of writing A bar.

113
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:31,280
So, for instance, mod 12, we could write that either, you know, we could write two bar as 26 bar and there is some sort of verification necessary to ensure that uh if we change the representative, we aren't changing the outcome on the right hand side.

114
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:43,030
So, is this well defined?

115
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:46,100
Answer is of course, a resounding yes.

116
01:06:47,450 --> 01:07:16,400
And so, I mean, well, just to make this completely explicit, if I have A1 bar equal B1 bar and A2 bar equal B2 bar, then A1 + B2 bar is A1 uh is uh sorry, A1 + B1 uh A1 or well, I could write this several different ways. But say A1 + A2 bar is B1 + B2 bar.

117
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:27,240
And likewise, A1 A2 bar is B1 B2 bar.

118
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:32,050
And it's a very, very easy verification. I'll just let you do that yourself.

119
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:40,290
Very easy verification.

120
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:57,620
But the critical observation here, or the first critical observation here, is that this addition law makes Z mod NZ into a group.

121
01:07:58,810 --> 01:08:04,180
observation

122
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:10,420
The observation is that this thing is a group.

123
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,890
Well, why?

124
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:17,560
Why is the thing associative?

125
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:21,030
Why is this plus operation associative?

126
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:26,150
Go ahead.

127
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,540
Because the operation Exactly.

128
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:33,240
It inherits it from the integers.

129
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:46,470
Um, this is going to be a sort of repeated theme. We're going to look at a generalization of this idea and always the things that look similar to this are going to be associative because the thing that we constructed them out of was associative.

130
01:08:47,230 --> 01:08:53,130
So, associative because Z+ was.

131
01:08:54,210 --> 01:09:09,210
In other words, if I write a + b bar, a bar + b bar + c bar or a bar + b bar + c bar, both of these things equal a + b + c all bar.

132
01:09:14,790 --> 01:09:21,300
The thing has uh um an identity element. What is it?

133
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:24,280
The class of zero.

134
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:27,390
Um, it has inverses.

135
01:09:28,610 --> 01:09:30,530
 Sorry?

136
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:34,310
Absolutely. Um, there are a couple of different ways of writing it.

137
01:09:34,310 --> 01:10:13,660
So, the inverse of A bar. Now, previously we'd used a sort of notation which was a power notation because we'd written our groups very multiplicatively. We'd written it as if the operation was multiplication. Here, we're writing our group with a plus sign. So it's very natural to write as the inverse of an element minus that thing. And so, as someone pointed out, this is, well, either there are many, many ways of writing this, but one can write it as n - A bar or just minus A bar.

138
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:28,090
Um And so in the language from last time, again, just sort of returning to what we did before.

139
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:51,430
So in the language from last time, the set of cosets of the subgroup NZ of Z form a group.

140
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:58,140
Is NZ a normal subgroup of Z?

141
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:00,710
Go ahead.

142
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:01,560
 Yes.

143
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:02,330
Yes?

144
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:07,090
Yes, it is. It is because Z is an abelian group.

145
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:22,400
And it's going to turn out that this isn't going to be true for arbitrary subgroups of a group. It's not going to be true that if I just have any subgroup, then the set of cosets are going to form a group. But it is going to be true in the case of normal subgroups.

146
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:28,300
But here that's just a trivial thing because Z is abelian, so every subgroup is a normal subgroup.

147
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,020
Is that clear? Are there any questions?

148
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:33,420
Very great. Oh, go ahead.

149
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:38,060
 you could just the one thing that you said just before any questions, could you repeat that?

150
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:54,200
Oh, I was just saying that um so it's not true that if I have some arbitrary subgroup, it's not going to be true. We're going to see this later on, but it's not going to be true that if I have an arbitrary subgroup of a group, then the set of cosets of that subgroup form a group.

151
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:59,100
But it will be true under the hypothesis that H is normal.

152
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:04,300
In the case of Z, this is a trivial hypothesis because all of its subgroups are normal.

153
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:22,270
Um, so, another observation.

154
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:28,590
So, a week ago, somebody asked the question,

155
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:32,820
is there a cyclic group of order n for every n?

156
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:42,240
And we gave an example of a subgroup of SN, the symmetric group on n letters, which was cyclic of order n.

157
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:49,010
So it's just this sort of cycle that goes one to two, two to three up to n which goes back to one.

158
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:53,980
Well, here's another nice construction of such a group.

159
01:12:55,360 --> 01:13:03,890
Z mod NZ is also cyclic of order N.

160
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:07,080
And it's a nice sort of model for a cyclic group of order n.

161
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:10,270
Remember, we saw that all cyclic groups of order n are isomorphic.

162
01:13:10,930 --> 01:13:15,490
So here is a very simple sort of way of studying cyclic groups of order n.

163
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:31,660
Of course, this is just generated by one bar because if I add one bar to itself K times, then this thing is just K bar.

164
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:45,410
So, I get all of one bar, two bar up to n - 1 bar and n bar, which is just zero bar.

165
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:59,980
 Excuse me, I I hate to say it I'm not exactly sure why one bar the second group generated by one bar is equal to Z mod Z.

166
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:10,880
So, why is the cyclic the question is, why is the cyclic group generated by one bar Z mod NZ? Well, what is the cyclic group?

167
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:24,730
It's the set of well, in one notation, the powers, but in our notation, this is sort of inappropriate.

168
01:14:25,230 --> 01:14:27,330
We don't want powers, we want multiples.

169
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:41,560
So, these are things that look like g + g n times or when they're negative powers putting in the inverse as n ranges over Z.

170
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:55,440
In particular, the cyclic subgroup generated by one bar contains, well, one bar, one bar plus one bar, one bar plus one bar plus one bar. So it certainly contains one bar added to itself K times.

171
01:14:55,950 --> 01:15:09,200
Well, if I add one bar to itself K times, then I get K bar because of associativity. 1 bar plus dot dot dot one bar just looks like 1 + K times all bar.

172
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:11,700
So that's K bar.

173
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:21,300
So, in particular, I have in the cyclic subgroup generated by one bar, one bar, two bar, all the way up to n - 1 bar and n bar, which is zero.

174
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:29,350
But we saw before that's all of the elements, that exhausts all of the elements of Z mod NZ.

175
01:15:30,690 --> 01:15:35,840
So, if everything that's in here is in here, then these must be equal.

176
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:37,700
Is that clear? Great.

177
01:15:44,210 --> 01:16:15,220
So, um I just uh maybe I'll just make something that I wrote over there even more explicit. notation When we use plus for our group operation, we write n times g for g added to itself n times, not the more multiplicative notation g to the n.

178
01:16:15,850 --> 01:16:37,780
So, be careful because for instance, there are certainly two operations that we've defined on Z mod NZ. They're different operations and they have different notations for them.

179
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:47,080
Okay.

180
01:16:47,950 --> 01:17:20,100
So, let's just make a further observation about just these two uh things. So, here's a further observation. The addition and multiplication on Z mod NZ distribute in the precise sense that if I multiply A bar times B bar plus c bar,

181
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:33,290
then this thing is the same as A bar B bar plus A bar C bar.

182
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:39,450
Now, of course, this seems like an utterly obvious thing because it's just inheriting what's going on from the integers.

183
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:48,050
So this is inherited from Z. And so it's a very, very simple verification.

184
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:58,240
Nonetheless, it's a very important point. It becomes a sort of repeated theme because we're going to have a lot of things that work very, very similarly to this.

185
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:04,470
And this is going to be a major theme when we get to the second part of the course on ring theory.

186
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:12,390
Okay, so,

187
01:18:12,850 --> 01:18:20,600
here's an example of the usefulness of modular arithmetic.

188
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:44,360
So, somebody tell me how to compute the last two digits in the decimal expansion of 2 to the 1,000.

189
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:45,700
Go ahead.

190
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:49,720
It's the um Exactly.

191
01:18:50,440 --> 01:19:12,600
So, the answer is, well, all we have to compute is 2 to the 1000 modulo 100, which makes the whole problem extremely manageable.

192
01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:26,390
So, completely explicitly, just to show you how easy this is and also uh an essential technique used by computers.

193
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:35,070
So I mean it's it's often the case that you need to do things which are analogous to computing the last couple digits in 2 to the 1000 for instance.

194
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:36,910
This is how computers do it.

195
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:46,380
They don't, you know, crank out all of two to the 1000 because that's rather large number uh and convert it to decimal notation. That would be not so efficient.

196
01:19:46,690 --> 01:19:57,680
So, here's a very, very simple short way of computing the thing. Well, this 2 to the 10 is 1024, which is congruent to 24 modulo 100.

197
01:19:58,270 --> 02:03,440
So, I I do this in part because it's just you sort of you have to get used to writing things in this kind of notation.

198
02:04,110 --> 02:10,960
Um if I square this, so 2 to the 20, well that's 2 to the 10 squared.

199
02:11,680 --> 02:25,210
Um, and that means this is 24 squared modulo 100, which is 576, which is congruent to 76 modulo 100.

200
02:25,500 --> 02:28,760
Are there any questions about the computation so far?

201
02:29,140 --> 02:32,070
Is this clear? To everyone?

202
02:34,520 --> 02:44,320
Now, if I square 76, this is 5776, which is just 76 mod 100.

203
02:45,150 --> 02:49,890
What is 76 to the N modulo 100?

204
02:50,470 --> 02:51,250
76.

205
02:51,980 --> 02:59,410
This implies that 76 to the N is congruent to 76 modulo 100 by induction.

206
03:00,480 --> 03:17,140
And so, well, this thing is 2 to the 20, which is uh, you know, sort of the 50th root of this thing, or in other words, this thing is this to the power 50, which is this to the power 50.

207
03:17,510 --> 03:22,910
So, 2 to the 1,000 is just congruent to 76 modulo 100.

208
03:23,340 --> 03:25,750
So the question is answered. Very, very simple.

209
03:29,150 --> 03:31,480
So far

210
03:31,480 --> 03:35,540
modular arithmetic

211
03:35,540 --> 03:38,010
has given us

212
03:38,010 --> 03:39,560
one group.

213
03:41,210 --> 03:48,340
Is Z mod NZ with the multiplication

214
03:48,340 --> 03:49,900
a group?

215
03:52,390 --> 03:53,310
Somebody?

216
03:55,980 --> 03:57,030
Yeah, somebody go ahead.

217
03:59,640 --> 04:00,130
Right.

218
04:00,130 --> 04:01,850
So this is definitely

219
04:01,850 --> 04:03,190
not a group.

220
04:03,690 --> 04:04,400
No.

221
04:05,560 --> 04:07,250
Because for instance,

222
04:07,250 --> 04:12,440
zero bar cannot possibly

223
04:12,440 --> 04:14,520
have an inverse.

224
04:16,220 --> 04:19,860
Because anything that you multiply it by gives you zero.

225
04:21,890 --> 04:26,160
But can somebody see a subgroup

226
04:26,160 --> 04:30,870
or can somebody see a subset of Z mod NZ which gives a group?

227
04:31,570 --> 04:32,310
Go ahead.

228
04:32,780 --> 04:33,180
Exactly.

229
04:33,180 --> 04:34,480
You just do the simplest thing.

230
04:34,860 --> 04:37,810
The problem here is that there are things which don't have inverses.

231
04:38,200 --> 04:39,890
So you just take the ones that have inverses.

232
04:42,820 --> 04:43,330
So,

233
04:43,330 --> 04:45,350
we define

234
04:45,350 --> 04:47,180
So, we also we do have

235
04:47,180 --> 04:50,410
a subset though

236
04:50,410 --> 04:55,240
of Z mod NZ which

237
04:55,240 --> 04:57,130
gives a group

238
04:57,130 --> 04:59,890
under multiplication.

239
05:00,570 --> 05:02,480
Explicitly,

240
05:03,400 --> 05:05,680
the set of things that have inverses.

241
05:06,690 --> 05:12,120
So, the A bar in Z mod NZ

242
05:12,120 --> 05:15,920
such that there is C bar

243
05:15,920 --> 05:19,510
in Z mod NZ such that

244
05:19,510 --> 05:25,180
A bar * C bar is one bar.

245
05:26,780 --> 05:31,740
And the notation for this thing is

246
05:31,740 --> 05:34,390
Z mod NZ cross.

247
05:34,910 --> 05:42,290
This should be a familiar notation to you because when we talked about the real numbers and the complex numbers, we added a cross to denote the non-zero elements.

248
05:42,870 --> 05:44,830
Well, those are exactly the elements which have inverses.

249
05:45,240 --> 05:47,180
So this is an entirely consistent notation.

250
05:49,970 --> 05:50,440
Okay.

251
05:50,440 --> 05:51,100
So, well,

252
05:51,100 --> 05:52,750
just to make sure that this is entirely clear,

253
05:52,750 --> 05:57,420
well, the associativity again is inherited

254
05:57,420 --> 05:58,980
from the integers.

255
05:59,520 --> 06:01,520
The identity, well, I've already said what it is,

256
06:01,520 --> 06:02,400
it's one bar.

257
06:03,200 --> 06:05,570
One bar has a natural inverse, namely itself.

258
06:06,230 --> 06:08,010
Um, so it's certainly in there.

259
06:08,770 --> 06:14,540
Um, and the inverses, well, that's by definition, inverses by construction.

260
06:16,100 --> 06:20,750
So let's have a brief recall on GCDs.

261
06:22,040 --> 06:27,370
Because we're going to want to discover the structure of this thing.

262
06:27,370 --> 06:29,260
We want to know what this thing looks like.

263
06:29,660 --> 06:34,110
And it turns out that this is tied up with some very, very elementary arithmetic.

264
06:38,070 --> 06:39,010
So,

265
06:40,540 --> 06:45,800
um, to understand Z mod NZ

266
06:45,800 --> 06:56,210
star review of greatest common divisors.

267
06:57,390 --> 07:04,590
So, if I have M and N integers, and I'm going to assume not they're not both zero.

268
07:06,820 --> 07:11,720
It's uh just a hypothesis that's going to make theorems easier to write down.

269
07:12,560 --> 07:14,170
So, what is the GCD?

270
07:16,620 --> 07:31,050
Well, you were probably taught this in elementary school as the largest positive integer, where this is a sort of redundant uh part of the the uh definition, the largest integer

271
07:32,930 --> 07:43,670
um that divides both of these things, dividing M and N. But for the purposes of sort of understanding the GCD,

272
07:43,670 --> 07:49,510
there is, of course, a better way of writing this down because it doesn't make reference to

273
07:49,510 --> 07:59,930
the order structure on the integers uh um inherited from the real numbers. In other words, it doesn't it doesn't talk about positive and negatives.

274
07:59,930 --> 08:11,420
There's another order structure, that that is induced by just multiplication or in other words, the division relationship between things.

275
08:12,060 --> 08:21,780
So, this is the unique positive integer um such that

276
08:22,510 --> 08:34,260
D divides M and N and if E divides M and N, then E divides D.

277
08:34,990 --> 08:45,000
And it's very, very easy to verify, of course, you've done this surely in another course that this number has this property.

278
08:48,260 --> 08:59,510
Now, the major fact, the main fact that that um I want to prove about GCDs

279
08:59,510 --> 09:01,510
is that

280
09:01,510 --> 09:13,270
they have a relationship to the group structure or subgroup structure on Z that we've studied so far.

281
09:13,930 --> 09:14,970
Yes. Question.

282
09:15,610 --> 09:19,880
 Sorry, what's the question?

283
09:19,880 --> 09:25,770
 Oh. unique positive integer D such that D divides M and N and if E if you have another common divisor,

284
09:25,770 --> 09:31,710
then it divides the greatest common divisor. So it's just it's just talking about the division structure of the thing.

285
09:34,000 --> 09:38,800
So, MZ + NZ. First question.

286
09:39,680 --> 09:44,890
These these are both subgroups of Z. Is MZ + NZ a subgroup of Z?

287
09:48,150 --> 09:51,290
The answer is yes, and it's not hard to see. I mean,

288
09:51,290 --> 09:52,720
zero is certainly in here.

289
09:53,540 --> 10:04,620
Uh it's certainly closed under addition and the uh uh negative of something in here is certainly again in here because these are just things of the form MR + NS.

290
10:04,620 --> 10:06,590
just negate those, etc.

291
10:07,190 --> 10:08,910
So this is certainly a subgroup.

292
10:09,420 --> 10:18,020
But we know what all the subgroups of Z look like, they look like some number, some positive integer in fact times Z.

293
10:18,670 --> 10:22,910
So any guesses as to what this is?

294
10:25,380 --> 10:27,470
Go ahead. Exactly.

295
10:27,900 --> 10:34,310
The answer is GCD of MN Z. That was a hard one um to guess.

296
10:34,800 --> 10:39,480
Proof. Well, this is this is a fairly easy verification, but I'll just go through it very quickly.

297
10:39,860 --> 10:41,530
So, as I said, this thing is a subgroup.

298
10:41,530 --> 10:57,140
So this is subgroup of Z. So it looks like something. So equals DZ for some Z, for some D rather. and we can assume D is a positive integer.

299
10:58,850 --> 11:07,330
Um Now, since M is in MZ + NZ, um

300
11:07,330 --> 11:14,570
which is exactly DZ, D certainly divides M.

301
11:15,850 --> 11:21,110
Same argument, D divides N.

302
11:21,630 --> 11:27,740
So, the first part of this is verified. The first part of this characterizing property is verified.

303
11:28,460 --> 11:32,450
Second part, well, suppose I have E

304
11:32,450 --> 11:34,580
dividing M and N.

305
11:35,520 --> 11:40,760
Well, because D is in DZ,

306
11:41,560 --> 11:45,670
I can write D as MR + NS.

307
11:46,310 --> 11:54,400
And if E divides M and E divides N, then E divides MR + NS and hence E divides D.

308
11:54,740 --> 11:55,990
Is that clear?

309
11:57,360 --> 11:59,330
So, this is exactly the characterizing property.

310
11:59,690 --> 12:08,150
This D divides M and N and if something divides M and N, then it divides D. So, we verified the properties and we've proved the lemma.

311
12:08,620 --> 12:10,450
So, there you go.

312
12:13,360 --> 12:16,320
Now, let's use this fact.

313
12:19,180 --> 12:23,640
Use this fact to prove

314
12:23,640 --> 12:26,490
proposition.

315
12:30,810 --> 12:36,390
Z mod NZ star

316
12:36,390 --> 12:42,570
looks like exactly the set of A bar in Z mod NZ

317
12:42,570 --> 12:44,880
such that, any guesses?

318
12:45,250 --> 12:45,890
Yes.

319
12:46,290 --> 12:46,760
 Exactly.

320
12:47,200 --> 12:56,900
The GCD of A and N is one, or to use uh a more abbreviated terminology, A and N are relatively prime.

321
12:57,670 --> 13:04,680
So this is very easy to prove now that we've established these sorts of basic arithmetic facts about the subgroups of Z.

322
13:07,830 --> 13:09,010
Um proof.

323
13:10,200 --> 13:13,370
Well, I mean, there is one subtle point here.

324
13:14,020 --> 13:17,940
What what would be a sort of subtle point in just writing down this set?

325
13:20,600 --> 13:21,340
Yes.

326
13:21,580 --> 13:29,580
 Well, the first thing is that um we don't know how many such A exist. Oh yeah.

327
13:30,080 --> 13:30,920
Well, yeah.

328
13:30,920 --> 13:44,580
Is is there another sort of There's a bit of an issue with writing this down because you'll notice that I I'm taking the A bar and Z mod NZ and no, on the left part of this and on the right part, I'm removing the bar.

329
13:45,030 --> 13:50,700
Now there's no unique lift. If I have some equivalence class A bar, there are many, many possible representatives.

330
13:51,300 --> 14:00,200
So there is a slightly subtle point here, namely that if I have one element of an equivalence class which is relatively prime to n, then every element of that equivalence class is also relatively prime to n.

331
14:00,770 --> 14:05,730
Now this isn't difficult to show, but it's certainly a bit of a subtlety in writing down this thing.

332
14:08,140 --> 14:10,820
But anyway, I'll go on and prove this proposition.

333
14:11,870 --> 14:16,000
So, first, the right hand side

334
14:16,000 --> 14:17,880
is included in the left hand side.

335
14:18,270 --> 14:24,830
Well, if I have GCD AN equals 1,

336
14:25,320 --> 14:26,880
then by the lemma,

337
14:27,820 --> 14:39,100
So the lemma implies that I can write, well, AZ + NZ equals Z, or put another way one or uh uh yeah, put another way, it's equivalent but it's also just something that follows immediately because one is in here.

338
14:39,100 --> 14:45,080
I can write one as AR + NS for some uh R and S.

339
14:45,860 --> 14:49,070
So, why is this significant? Well, this tells us

340
14:51,140 --> 14:58,090
that AR - 1 is in NZ or put another way,

341
14:58,090 --> 15:01,460
A bar R bar is one bar.

342
15:02,660 --> 15:08,920
So, A bar is certainly in um Z mod NZ

343
15:08,920 --> 15:10,220
cross.

344
15:11,010 --> 15:15,920
Now, the converse is very, very similar.

345
15:16,260 --> 15:19,710
So, left hand side contained in right hand side.

346
15:20,630 --> 15:26,580
Well, do the same sort of thing. If I have A bar * c bar equals 1 bar,

347
15:27,400 --> 15:33,120
then I can write AC - 1 equals NB for some integer B.

348
15:33,790 --> 15:48,730
So, 1 which is AC + NB is in AZ + NZ. But this thing is just GCD AN Z.

349
15:49,590 --> 15:59,920
And if one is in the subgroup of the form DZ, then that D must be plus or minus one, it must be one.

350
16:01,460 --> 16:05,970
Because if this were like two or three or four or something, one couldn't possibly be in there.

351
16:06,270 --> 16:11,950
One uh two does not have a multiplicative inverse in Z for instance.

352
16:12,670 --> 16:16,730
So, this proves the result. This gives us sort of structure.

353
16:17,340 --> 16:28,660
So, example, what does Z mod PZ cross look like?

354
16:30,280 --> 16:31,260
Yeah, go ahead.

355
16:31,730 --> 16:34,900
Everything except zero.

356
16:35,760 --> 16:41,630
All of 1, 2, 3 up to p - 1 are certainly relatively prime to p.

357
16:41,960 --> 16:46,280
So this is 1, 2 up to p - 1.

358
16:48,090 --> 17:17,730
So another example, more generally, what is the order of Z mod P to the E Z star? Any takers? Yes.

359
17:19,670 --> 17:20,510
Yeah.

360
17:20,700 --> 17:24,160
 It's P raised to E minus P raised to E minus 1. Why?

361
17:25,330 --> 17:39,020
So the answer he gave is P to the E - P to the E - 1. Basically that's phi of P to the E, so Well, that's Okay, so the answer he gave makes a sort of reference to some number theoretic background.

362
17:39,520 --> 17:42,570
But there's a very simple combinatorial way of seeing why that's true.

363
17:42,780 --> 17:43,480
Yes, go ahead.

364
17:43,820 --> 17:47,480
 Exactly.

365
17:48,230 --> 17:50,910
This is everything except the multiples of P.

366
17:51,530 --> 17:53,210
What are the multiples of P?

367
17:53,610 --> 18:01,170
The multiples of P are 1 * p, 2 * p, 3 * p up to p to the E - 1 * p.

368
18:01,780 --> 18:19,030
These are exactly the things, the things not relatively prime to P.

369
18:19,690 --> 18:31,990
So we started out with a set of P to the E things, we took away P to the E - 1 things which were not relatively prime, and we're left over with P to the E - P to the E - 1 things which are relatively prime.

370
18:36,060 --> 18:39,770
Okay. So this is a first sort of introduction to modular arithmetic.

371
18:40,270 --> 18:48,820
But what we're going to be doing in the next class is sort of riffing further on the theme from the first part, which is just this sort of additive structure.

372
18:49,570 --> 18:56,080
Um, this multiplicative structure is something that we're going to get to only later in the course.

373
18:56,550 --> 19:00,570
in greater detail, but it's certainly useful to have seen now because you need it as a tool.

374
19:00,980 --> 19:16,200
But what we're going to start discussing later on is that, as I said uh alluded to before, if I have some normal subgroup H of G,

375
19:16,630 --> 19:32,140
we're going to be able to look at the coset space, which we're going to denote g mod H. So this is the set of cosets of H in G.

376
19:33,250 --> 19:36,250
And we're going to see that there's a natural homomorphism.

377
19:40,960 --> 19:59,900
There is a natural homomorphism from G to g mod H with full image and kernel exactly H.

378
19:59,900 --> 20:14,520
And this will answer a question that one of you had in the last class. If one has a normal subgroup, is there always a homomorphism which has that normal subgroup as its kernel?

379
20:14,890 --> 20:29,660
We've answered that in the special case of the group Z today. Why? Well, because the set of normal subgroups of Z are exactly the set of subgroups of Z, which are the things of the form NZ.

380
20:30,140 --> 20:40,770
And we saw that there's a natural map which I called red,

381
20:40,770 --> 20:55,090
short for reduction because this is the terminology used from Z to Z mod NZ.

382
20:56,100 --> 21:01,890
And I didn't verify this, but it's a very easy verification that this map is a homomorphism.

383
21:03,150 --> 21:04,880
Well, I did do it in some sense.

384
21:04,880 --> 21:19,930
Um, I mean, that was just sort of the idea that if I could write A bar plus c bar, then that was the same thing as a plus c bar because this map is just taking some A to A bar.

385
21:20,510 --> 21:25,450
So this is a verification of the fact that this is a homomorphism.

386
21:26,330 --> 21:34,240
Moreover, it's surjective by construction. And finally,

387
21:34,670 --> 21:40,920
this is a good verification. The kernel is exactly NZ.

388
21:42,100 --> 21:52,000
So what we're going to do next time is see why this continues to work for any normal subgroup of a group.

389
21:53,810 --> 21:55,710
Right. Thanks.
