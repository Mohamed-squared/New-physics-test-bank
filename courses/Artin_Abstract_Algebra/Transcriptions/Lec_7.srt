1
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:17,872
Okay. Let's get started. Uh, so I put up the homework that's due on Wednesday.

2
00:00:17,872 --> 00:00:21,282
where we're going to finish up this first chapter on group theory.

3
00:00:21,282 --> 00:00:28,622
and then we're going to take a little time away from group theory and enter into the theory of vector spaces over general fields.

4
00:00:28,622 --> 00:00:39,862
So you've probably studied vector spaces over the real and complex numbers. We're going to study them a little bit more abstractly

5
00:00:39,862 --> 00:00:45,332
and do linear algebra in its full level of generality.

6
00:00:45,332 --> 00:00:47,812
And then we're going to return to do more on groups.

7
00:00:47,992 --> 00:00:51,432
So let me remember where Peter left you uh last time.

8
00:00:51,782 --> 00:00:57,492
We have this wonderful group which is the integers under addition.

9
00:00:57,952 --> 00:00:59,302
That's our basic group.

10
00:00:59,972 --> 00:01:09,062
And uh we identified all the subgroups have the form

11
01:09,592 --> 01:14,332
N times the integers,

12
01:14,752 --> 01:17,892
where n is some integer greater than or equal to zero.

13
01:18,212 --> 01:20,722
So the multiples of some fixed integer.

14
01:20,722 --> 01:24,132
That's what we showed way back when we did the structure of this group.

15
01:24,432 --> 01:27,422
Remember we used the Euclidean algorithm to prove that.

16
01:27,682 --> 01:32,672
And last time Peter associated to every subgroup,

17
01:32,962 --> 01:39,532
So this is our subgroup H.

18
01:40,622 --> 01:42,312
This is our group G.

19
01:43,502 --> 01:46,512
each H in G a new group,

20
01:46,792 --> 01:55,102
which he denoted Z mod NZ.

21
01:55,342 --> 01:57,402
So that's notation that's due to Gauss.

22
01:57,592 --> 02:01,552
So this would be called Z mod N.

23
02:03,392 --> 02:15,242
This notation and this group was defined on the first sentence of Gauss's great book, the disquisitiones arithmetici, published in 1801,

24
02:15,552 --> 02:23,802
where uh this is the notation mod N comes from the Latin word modulus.

25
02:24,062 --> 02:26,242
The disquisitiones is written in Latin.

26
02:26,442 --> 02:33,992
If I can get the first two pages from you from Hoton Library, I'll print them out and distribute. They're they're a presee of mathematical writing.

27
02:34,232 --> 02:45,992
And this new group Zmod NZ consists of the classes of integers where you only keep track of their remainder after division by N.

28
02:46,182 --> 03:09,672
So we we we have elements A bar in Z mod NZ and A bar depends on the remainder of the integer A after division by N.

29
03:10,412 --> 03:19,322
So in particular, if A and B are integers, we have A bar equal to B bar

30
03:19,622 --> 03:27,432
or as Gauss would write it, A congruent to B mod N. That's Gauss's notation.

31
03:27,532 --> 03:39,692
We'd say A bar is equal to B bar in the group Z mod NZ if and only if n divides A minus B.

32
03:40,332 --> 03:49,752
And so in particular, this new group, which only depends on the remainder, has only n elements in it.

33
03:49,752 --> 04:03,942
So this new group you could say consists of the elements 0 bar, one bar, two bar up to n - 1 bar because those are the only things that are possible remainders. That's the group Z mod NZ.

34
04:04,342 --> 04:12,882
And the addition law is by adding two things in the integers and then um calculating the remainder after division by n.

35
04:13,132 --> 04:22,412
So A bar plus B bar in Z mod NZ is equal to a + B bar.

36
04:22,772 --> 04:30,492
Namely, add them in the integers, this is in Z, and then take the remainder after reducing mod n.

37
04:30,702 --> 04:35,862
And this gives the structure of a group on this set of n elements.

38
04:36,252 --> 04:38,662
And in fact, it's a cyclic group.

39
04:39,252 --> 04:48,312
of order n generated by the class one bar.

40
04:48,642 --> 05:00,842
Because if you take one bar and you add it to itself, you get two bar, and then if you add one bar, you get three bar, and you add another one, you get four bar, and you get up to n - 1 bar, and then you add one to that, you get back to the identity element.

41
05:01,272 --> 05:07,952
So this gives another description of a cyclic group of order n. Remember, we claimed that there was one for each value n.

42
05:08,182 --> 05:17,762
This is the notation I'll use for a cyclic group of order n. It has the advantage that it not only is a cyclic group, but it has a natural generator, one bar.

43
05:18,122 --> 05:22,882
Just like the integers are a cyclic group with a natural generator one.

44
05:23,832 --> 05:28,922
This is an infinite cyclic group. This is a finite cyclic group of every order n.

45
05:29,772 --> 05:37,442
Moreover, we have a natural group homomorphism F from Z to Z mod NZ,

46
05:37,662 --> 05:49,462
which takes the class of A to the class of A bar, IE A mod N.

47
05:47,082 --> 05:50,142
The remainder of A after division by N.

48
05:50,692 --> 06:12,022
And this is a group homomorphism which is onto, which is surjective, because every class in this group is the remainder of something, surjective with kernel N Z.

49
06:12,272 --> 06:18,692
Namely the things that go to zero bar are exactly the things divisible by n. So there's our subgroup.

50
06:19,542 --> 06:27,512
So, to recapitulate what Peter did last time, and this is a great construction of Gaus, which is the first example of this in the literature,

51
06:28,182 --> 06:29,632
in 1801,

52
06:30,572 --> 06:37,842
before Galois had invented the general notion of a group, associated to each subgroup of the integers under addition,

53
06:38,252 --> 06:42,602
we construct a new group, which is called the quotient group.

54
06:43,252 --> 06:46,272
We're going to do that more generally this time.

55
06:47,022 --> 06:55,682
The quotient group, such that there is a surjective homomorphism from the group to the quotient group with kernel the subgroup.

56
06:56,872 --> 06:58,002
Okay?

57
06:58,432 --> 07:02,402
Now, this is a much richer case than the average group.

58
07:02,642 --> 07:13,012
And the reason it's a richer case, and Peter went into this a little bit last time and we'll return to it, is that the integers have a much richer structure than just addition.

59
07:13,672 --> 07:18,302
Right? The integers also can have the product structure multiplication.

60
07:18,512 --> 07:23,462
Namely, the integers not only form a group under addition, they form a ring.

61
07:23,652 --> 07:32,932
So this also also have the operation

62
07:32,932 --> 07:44,202
times. And when you have both in a group addition and a multiplication structure and they're suitably compatible, that's what we call a ring. And we're going to get to that. I promise you this term.

63
07:44,522 --> 07:50,322
And in fact, this quotient group also has the structure of a ring.

64
07:50,562 --> 07:54,232
You can multiply remainders. And it's still compatible.

65
07:54,502 --> 08:03,592
Namely, you can define A bar times B bar by taking A * B in the integers and then taking its remainder.

66
08:03,812 --> 08:06,442
And that's a well-defined multiplication.

67
08:06,662 --> 08:13,222
So this is not just a finite cyclic group of order n, but it also allows you to multiply elements in it.

68
08:13,582 --> 08:27,802
That's a remarkable property. And most of the disquisitiones, in fact, one might say all of the disquisitiones is concerned with the properties of those finite rings.

69
08:28,322 --> 08:37,602
Quadratic reciprocity theorem, the chordic reciprocity, all these great results that Gauss discovered are about the properties of this finite ring.

70
08:37,822 --> 08:47,602
And Peter discovered introduced you last time to another thing. You see, if you have a ring, and I'm just going to say this very briefly, it's not necessary right now.

71
08:47,992 --> 09:02,642
So you have a bo it's a group under plus with an origin, and then there's a times operation with an identity element one, but not not necessarily inverses.

72
09:03,002 --> 09:05,142
For example, zero has no inverse.

73
09:05,612 --> 09:08,882
You can't multiply anything by zero and get to one.

74
09:09,322 --> 09:25,682
Nonetheless, you get a subset of the ring called R star, which is sometimes called the units of the ring, which is the set of elements A and R such that there exists a B such that AB is equal to one.

75
09:26,262 --> 09:32,662
So there there are the elements which have multiplicative inverses.

76
09:33,512 --> 09:40,082
Everything has an additive inverse. Now, that can be a rather small.

77
09:40,732 --> 09:44,122
And this is another group.

78
09:44,362 --> 09:52,292
So ring has is a group under addition, and you get a second group from a ring, which is the unit group, which is a group under multiplication.

79
09:52,892 --> 09:56,532
And it can be a rather small group.

80
09:56,832 --> 10:04,142
For example, this is the most famous ring of them all, the integers. All rings are modeled on the integers.

81
10:04,382 --> 10:12,302
If you ask yourself, what is the multiplicative group associated to the integers? Namely, which integers have multiplicative inverses?

82
10:12,752 --> 10:17,152
The answer is very simple. Just +1 and -1.

83
10:17,392 --> 10:22,742
There is no multiplicative inverse for two because one half is not an integer.

84
10:23,152 --> 10:32,452
So for this ring, we would find that the multiplicative group here is just the group on two elements, plus or minus one.

85
10:32,782 --> 10:35,272
That's a kind of a stupid group, but there it is.

86
10:35,532 --> 10:42,732
On the other hand, as Peter pointed out, these finite rings have very interesting multiplicative groups, very interesting.

87
10:43,072 --> 10:46,662
And we're going to get into that later when we do the the ring theory.

88
10:46,892 --> 10:53,792
And Gauss was the first person to work out the structure of the multiplicative group of units in those rings.

89
10:53,952 --> 11:02,662
But right now, for this point of view of this lecture, it's only important that we inherit the additive group structure and that we have this additive group homomorphism.

90
11:03,582 --> 11:11,932
Before I go any further, are there questions on this construction? because it's very basic. It's the model for what we're going to follow when we do a quotient group in general.

91
11:12,712 --> 11:13,962
Okay.

92
11:14,642 --> 11:17,492
So let me be a little bit more general than this.

93
11:17,812 --> 11:22,692
Now, this is a particularly simple group, as I said to you, this is an abelian group.

94
11:23,252 --> 11:36,312
So we have to pay attention and see what properties are we really using of these subgroups when we construct this quotient group? Can we do it for any subgroup or is there some peculiar property of the subgroup that we need?

95
11:36,862 --> 11:43,632
So, let me start off in a simple situation where the subgroup is defined by a group homomorphism.

96
11:44,932 --> 11:51,832
By the way, these classes in Zmod NZ are just the cosets of this subgroup.

97
11:52,292 --> 12:02,502
represent the cosets of NZ, the distinct cosets.

98
12:03,382 --> 12:08,172
So the quotient group is a set is the set of cosets of the subgroup.

99
12:08,452 --> 12:11,242
And yet we're able to give a multiplication on it.

100
12:11,572 --> 12:30,342
So that's going to be our question. When can we put a group structure on the set of all cosets AH

101
12:30,812 --> 12:40,802
for a subgroup H in G.

102
12:41,982 --> 12:48,972
We always get a if we have a subgroup, we get a set. It's set of cosets. And we've seen that that gives a partition of the group.

103
12:49,312 --> 13:03,262
Here's our group. Here's H. Here's AH. Here's BH. So we get a nice partition of the group into cosets. So the set of cosets

104
13:03,542 --> 13:06,252
is a nice set. When can we get a group structure on it?

105
13:06,382 --> 13:17,302
So one case, case one. Suppose H is equal to the kernel of a homomorphism F from G to G prime.

106
13:17,792 --> 13:20,282
That's one way we get subgroups.

107
13:21,442 --> 13:30,612
Then the set of cosets AH

108
13:31,242 --> 13:34,292
is in bijection with what?

109
13:34,552 --> 13:38,342
What do we how do we get a coset out of a homomorphism?

110
13:38,582 --> 13:39,562
You remember that?

111
13:39,772 --> 13:43,582
H was the kernel of it. What are the other cosets?

112
13:44,352 --> 13:45,342
The...

113
13:45,682 --> 13:46,492
Yeah."

114
13:46,492 --> 13:48,702
The fibers. Exactly right.

115
13:49,062 --> 13:53,202
Namely, we had a map here from G to G prime.

116
13:53,622 --> 13:55,452
It needn't be a subjective map.

117
13:55,712 --> 14:05,192
But above each point in g prime, A bar, we have the fiber which is an entire coset of the kernel.

118
14:05,722 --> 14:13,802
And we had another point here, B bar, you got its fiber, all the things mapping to B bar, right?

119
14:14,572 --> 14:19,422
So the set of cosets are the fibers of the map.

120
14:20,222 --> 14:29,322
So therefore, can they can be identified bijectively with the points A bar in the image.

121
14:29,832 --> 14:33,502
which is contained in g prime.

122
14:34,372 --> 14:44,152
Correct? Each coset corresponds bijectively to a point in the image, which is some little thing in here. Image of F.

123
14:44,762 --> 14:49,502
And the image of a homomorphism is what?

124
14:49,772 --> 14:51,812
Among other things, it's a subgroup."

125
14:51,812 --> 14:53,922
It's a subgroup.

126
14:54,522 --> 15:07,342
But the image of F is a subgroup. It's stable under multiplication in G prime of G prime.

127
15:08,142 --> 15:17,552
Therefore, since the set of cosets is in bijection with the set of the image, and we have a group structure on the set on the image set,"

128
15:17,822 --> 15:22,212
that gives us a group structure on the set of cosets, right?

129
15:22,482 --> 15:24,462
Good. So we transfer,

130
15:24,712 --> 15:35,262
sometimes mathematicians, if they wanted to be sophisticated would say we we transport the structure of the image onto the set of cosets.

131
15:35,482 --> 15:38,572
Or if you wanted to be even more sophisticated, you say it in French.

132
15:38,812 --> 15:44,542
Because that's a favorite expression of Burbaki that wrote up a lot of 20th century mathematics.

133
15:44,542 --> 15:52,372
You'd say, par transport structure on structure group sur l'ensemble des coset."

134
15:52,372 --> 15:53,932
Okay? Coset is what in French?

135
15:54,122 --> 15:55,992
Coset? Did I do that right? Not bad.

136
15:56,212 --> 15:57,772
You must learn French.

137
15:58,132 --> 16:03,892
If you aspire to be a mathematician, you want to say things precisely, they must be said in French.

138
16:04,222 --> 16:16,192
English is, of course, the worldwide language of of of mathematics and science nowadays and it's become even more so uh in the last in the last 25 years, but uh there's certain types of mathematics you can only say in trance. So we'll say par transport the structure,"

139
16:17,472 --> 16:34,112
we get a group structure on the set and we'll call that set g mod h

140
16:34,442 --> 16:40,302
of cosets.

141
16:41,032 --> 16:57,552
And the group structure has the following form. When you multiply the coset AH by the coset BH, then I claim that the answer is which coset is the product? It's just the coset of AB times H.

142
16:58,462 --> 17:01,622
Okay?"

143
17:02,292 --> 17:08,152
Why? Because if I want to figure out how to multiply this coset by this coset,"

144
17:08,412 --> 17:13,472
I have to figure out how to multiply A bar by B bar, right?

145
17:13,682 --> 17:17,462
That's the multiplication law I'm going to use, the multiplication law in G prime.

146
17:17,742 --> 17:23,012
So, what is A bar times B bar?

147
17:23,382 --> 17:28,132
Well, it's the bar of something cuz it's in the image. What is it the bar of?"

148
17:28,412 --> 17:44,332
Well, we figured this out by writing A bar as f of A and writing B bar as f of B and then using the fact that F is a homomorphism and then this number is just what we would call AB bar.

149
17:44,332 --> 17:46,052
Okay?"

150
17:46,562 --> 17:55,572
So the product of the image element A bar by the image element B bar is the bar of AB, where this multiplication takes place in G."

151
17:56,272 --> 18:06,662
So that's what I mean. So when you want to multiply two cosets, you just take an element A in one of them, you take an element in B in the other, you take the product of those elements and you take its coset.

152
18:07,462 --> 18:09,042
Okay?"

153
18:09,272 --> 18:31,362
And moreover, this makes the map F new map, let's call it uh capital F from G to g mod h taking A to the coset AH a group homomorphism.

154
18:32,272 --> 18:44,332
A subjective group homomorphism because this is the multiplication law.

155
18:44,892 --> 18:49,812
It's just it's coming it's inherited from the multiplication law in G.

156
18:49,992 --> 18:56,402
So if we have a group homomorphism and we let H be the kernel, then by using the multiplication on the image,"

157
18:56,692 --> 19:06,422
we can make the set of cosets, which is denoted like this, into a group, which is called the quotient group.

158
19:07,082 --> 19:11,512
And the multiplication law looks like this.

159
19:12,222 --> 19:19,252
And if you think about what we did for Z mod NZ, that's very it's it's a similar multiplication law. Yeah, good."

160
19:19,472 --> 19:31,622
When you were saying that um the map little F creates a group on G, I think I No, no. There's always a group on big G."

161
19:31,972 --> 19:36,402
And there's a group on little on G prime, and there's a homomorphism between them.

162
19:36,672 --> 19:42,342
Now, there's a group structure on the image because that we agreed was a subgroup of G prime.

163
19:42,922 --> 19:44,072
Okay?"

164
19:44,322 --> 19:49,202
Now, the cosets are identified bijectively one to one with the points in the image."

165
19:49,452 --> 19:54,872
Therefore, it tells us how to multiply one coset by another coset and get a third coset.

166
19:55,332 --> 20:00,352
That's different than multiplying elements in G. We're multiplying elements of a different set.

167
20:01,192 --> 20:03,422
And the multiplication law is this."

168
20:04,222 --> 20:08,372
by inheriting the structure of the group on the image.

169
20:08,612 --> 20:15,702
Okay. Now, this worked pretty well. Let's forget that we had a homomorphism.

170
20:16,172 --> 20:18,472
All right? So now try better.

171
20:18,762 --> 20:20,442
Better."

172
20:21,422 --> 20:29,422
Let H in G be any subgroup.

173
20:29,742 --> 20:30,742
Okay?"

174
20:31,272 --> 20:42,462
Uh let the cosets G mod H be the set of all cosets AH."

175
20:43,282 --> 20:46,202
That's a good set. We defined that for any subgroup now.

176
20:46,472 --> 20:48,952
We know what a coset is."

177
20:49,262 --> 20:52,552
That gives a partition of G.

178
20:53,012 --> 21:13,912
Okay? Define a group structure on g mod h by setting the product AH times the coset BH to be the coset of AB times h.

179
21:14,382 --> 21:16,512
That's what we did here. That's what worked."

180
21:16,722 --> 21:19,782
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

181
21:20,342 --> 21:28,482
So, I'm now going to try, maybe I should say two, try to define a group structure on the set of cosets by that law.

182
21:28,732 --> 21:30,962
That's what worked for us here.

183
21:31,282 --> 21:34,632
If we multiply two cosets here, we got a third coset.

184
21:35,072 --> 21:36,572
Why don't we try it here?"

185
21:36,802 --> 21:38,092
Okay.

186
21:38,342 --> 21:40,662
Now, I said try.

187
21:40,992 --> 21:42,842
This fails. It fails."

188
21:42,972 --> 21:45,702
I'm going to show you now it fails. So you shouldn't get too optimistic.

189
21:45,962 --> 21:47,052
But you should always try.

190
21:47,482 --> 21:53,712
You never get anything in math by just saying, well, everyone's always done it that way, I'll do it this way. Right? You have to try something else.

191
21:54,012 --> 21:56,302
So the reason it fails is the following.

192
21:56,732 --> 22:06,002
You have to ask, before you get the group structure and everything. By the way, you have to check that this is associative, you have to figure out what the identity element. By the way, what's the identity element in the quotient group?"

193
22:08,332 --> 22:10,932
The identity element?

194
22:11,522 --> 22:23,102
Identity element has to be the image of the identity under this homomorphism is equal to E bar, which is the coset of E, which is just the coset H.

195
22:23,422 --> 22:26,232
That's the only distinguished coset you have. So this becomes the identity element in the quotient group."

196
22:26,922 --> 22:30,192
Okay?"

197
22:30,432 --> 22:32,632
How about the inverse element?"

198
22:32,632 --> 22:35,342
Now that we know the the inverse. What's the inverse of the coset AH?"

199
22:35,852 --> 22:38,052
What could it be? A inverse."

200
22:38,362 --> 22:40,592
The coset of A inverse.

201
22:41,042 --> 22:44,132
See, because A * A inverse is the identity element.

202
22:44,722 --> 22:51,572
So if I took inverse, it would be AH inverse is A inverse h.

203
22:51,872 --> 22:59,482
But those are all details. I mean, first you have to have a multiplication law before you get the identity and the inverse and associative and this and that and the other thing.

204
22:59,962 --> 23:05,342
So, why what would be the problem with this as a multiplication law?

205
23:05,742 --> 23:09,222
It looks pretty good. I tell you how to multiply this coset by this coset.

206
23:09,462 --> 23:14,312
I tell you it's that coset. Yeah."

207
23:15,752 --> 23:22,902
Well if AH is the same as like some CH. Ah, good. Exactly.

208
23:23,142 --> 23:26,272
Namely the question is, is this well defined?"

209
23:26,762 --> 23:35,102
Because the coset is not uniquely written as AH.

210
23:35,432 --> 23:40,562
Namely, if AH is equal to A prime H,

211
23:41,172 --> 23:47,192
if A and A prime are in the same coset, and BH is equal to B prime H,

212
23:47,962 --> 23:55,782
is ABH equal to A prime B prime H?"

213
23:56,132 --> 24:04,302
Namely, if we're saying that this coset times this coset is this coset, we better make sure that doesn't depend on what representative we've chosen for the coset.

214
24:04,562 --> 24:08,042
And there's no unique way of writing a non-trivial coset.

215
24:08,262 --> 24:18,072
You just have to pick something in it. Here we called it AH because the element A was in it, but we could have had another element A prime in it and written it as A prime H.

216
24:18,302 --> 24:25,522
And if we say that this multiplication law depends only on the coset, we better make sure that no matter what representative we choose, it works.

217
24:25,802 --> 24:29,022
Now, in this case, it has to work because it's the law on the image.

218
24:29,422 --> 24:32,432
All right? But I'm going to show you that it doesn't always work.

219
24:32,992 --> 24:41,682
So the to answer to this first question is okay if H is equal to the kernel of a homomorphism from G to G prime.

220
24:42,082 --> 24:44,512
There."

221
24:44,682 --> 24:47,632
Two, not in general.

222
24:48,162 --> 25:09,442
Suppose AH A inverse is not equal to h.

223
25:10,272 --> 25:15,412
I.e, AH is not equal to HA."

224
25:16,392 --> 25:18,082
Okay?"

225
25:18,402 --> 25:28,342
For some element in the group A, for some A, the conjugate of H is not equal to itself

226
25:28,582 --> 25:29,522
as a set."

227
25:30,102 --> 25:36,342
Then I'm going to show you that this definition encounters some serious problems. Some serious problems.

228
25:36,722 --> 25:46,362
Because let's multiply the coset AH by the coset A inverse H.

229
25:47,042 --> 25:49,362
Under this definition,

230
25:49,742 --> 25:52,802
it would get me what coset? E."

231
25:53,202 --> 25:55,232
It would get me the coset H.

232
25:55,542 --> 25:57,922
Because A * A inverse is E.

233
25:58,362 --> 26:02,582
So this would be EH is equal to H

234
26:02,922 --> 26:07,202
under this definition.

235
26:08,062 --> 26:19,032
Now, if you think about this requirement, this says since this would be true for any A prime in AH, and this would be true for any B prime in BH, it says that this definition will only work"

236
26:19,412 --> 26:27,332
if the product of anything in here times the product of anything in here is in this coset.

237
26:27,682 --> 26:29,392
Right?"

238
26:29,652 --> 26:36,482
Because I could take anything here is my A prime and anything here is my B prime, and then I make better make sure that A prime B prime is in this coset.

239
26:36,762 --> 26:42,162
In other words, that this coset is equal to that coset.

240
26:42,722 --> 26:53,122
So, if I were going to use this as my multiplication law, I would have to say that anything in here times anything in here was an H.

241
26:54,092 --> 26:55,292
Right?"

242
26:55,692 --> 26:58,002
Now I'm going to show you that's false. That's false."

243
26:58,422 --> 27:01,312
So that definition is out the window.

244
27:01,842 --> 27:08,022
Can someone give me a product of something in here times something in here which is not in H? Yeah, Emily.

245
27:08,562 --> 27:12,402
Okay, so some elements in AH is not equal to A and the..."

246
27:12,842 --> 27:23,672
Okay. So this says here that there exists an element H and H such that A H A inverse is not in H.

247
27:24,242 --> 27:30,082
Right? That's this statement here. There exists one element in here such that when I conjugate it, I get out of H.

248
27:30,532 --> 27:31,402
Okay?"

249
27:31,772 --> 27:44,102
So I take as a suggestion the element AH in here, right? And I take the element in here, A inverse times E, which is certainly good.

250
27:44,782 --> 27:49,662
And I take their product and I get AH A inverse, which is not in H.

251
27:50,252 --> 27:57,542
by my hypothesis."

252
27:58,172 --> 28:08,142
So, if I have a subgroup which has the property that some conjugate leaves the subgroup, I can forget about this definition because it's not well defined.

253
28:08,422 --> 28:13,562
Before I even checked any properties of it, it's not even a well-defined multiplication.

254
28:14,032 --> 28:20,432
It's not true that the product of anything in this coset times the product of anything in this coset is in here.

255
28:20,902 --> 28:30,372
Okay. Now, how come if we're so if we're now we have to sort of sort. How come it worked in one but not in general?

256
28:30,622 --> 28:34,742
What was so special about the H that were in one? Yeah.

257
28:35,382 --> 28:37,562
It's a billion."

258
28:37,822 --> 28:39,362
Not quite, but close."

259
28:39,862 --> 28:42,112
It's a normal subgroup."

260
28:42,412 --> 28:54,542
Namely, the kernel of a homomorphism has the property that AH A inverse is equal to H for all A in G.

261
28:54,772 --> 28:59,352
That's what we called a normal subgroup."

262
28:59,352 --> 29:01,882
Gaus terminology."

263
29:02,202 --> 29:04,032
Subgroup."

264
29:04,362 --> 29:23,332
Because if you apply the homomorphism to anything of the form AH A inverse, using the fact that F of H is the identity, you get F of A times F of the identity times F of A inverse, and F of A inverse is the same as f of A inverse, so the product of those things is the identity and you're still in H, you're still in the kernel.

265
29:23,582 --> 29:27,062
The kernel is not an arbitrary subgroup. It's a normal subgroup."

266
29:27,322 --> 29:36,492
And so, since it worked in this case, we might see and it doesn't work in general, if this happens, we might see if normality is what we need.

267
29:37,182 --> 29:40,072
Okay."

268
29:40,692 --> 29:46,532
Three. Assume that H is normal in G.

269
29:47,022 --> 29:57,162
So AH A inverse is equal to H for all A in G.

270
29:57,442 --> 30:06,222
In other words, we could write this is AH is equal to HA

271
30:06,622 --> 30:12,502
as sets.

272
30:13,042 --> 30:14,132
Okay?"

273
30:14,682 --> 30:18,042
Doesn't mean that A commutes with everything in H.

274
30:18,312 --> 30:28,312
It means that if you have an element in H, that AH can be written as some H prime A for H prime in H.

275
30:28,692 --> 30:33,812
Okay? It it just preserves it as a set. Doesn't commute with everything in H.

276
30:34,322 --> 30:35,402
Okay?"

277
30:35,772 --> 30:45,362
Now, in this case, the naive multiplication law

278
30:46,092 --> 30:48,412
on cosets"

279
30:48,922 --> 30:58,142
And by the naive multiplication law on cosets, oh oh, I'm going to violate a cinematic principle here. I mean this thing which is in a different quadrant,"

280
30:58,542 --> 30:59,872
apologies.

281
31:00,312 --> 31:01,182
Okay."

282
31:01,682 --> 31:22,352
The naive multiplication law on cosets actually works is well defined and defines a group structure on g mod h, on the set of cosets.

283
31:23,212 --> 31:25,522
Now, that wasn't obvious from two.

284
31:25,762 --> 31:30,762
All we said was if this didn't work, then you didn't get a group from the naive multiplication law.

285
31:30,982 --> 31:37,582
So we still have something to check. Namely, we just said, well, this didn't work. Let's assume this works. Now everything's okay. We have to check that.

286
31:38,062 --> 31:39,482
Correct?"

287
31:39,762 --> 31:41,262
So let's check it.

288
31:41,552 --> 31:48,742
We have to show that if you take all things in this coset and you multiply them by all things in this coset, you get a coset, namely this coset.

289
31:48,982 --> 31:51,422
Okay?"

290
31:51,902 --> 32:02,292
Check. Well, suppose we multiply AH by BH."

291
32:02,972 --> 32:06,082
in this"

292
32:06,742 --> 32:14,132
And you just this means by this I mean take any element in here and multiply it by any element in there.

293
32:14,402 --> 32:16,432
As sets. Let's just calculate the set.

294
32:16,762 --> 32:27,472
by calculating the set of all products"

295
32:27,982 --> 32:35,472
So this means everything of the form AH BH prime in G.

296
32:35,722 --> 32:37,222
That's that set.

297
32:37,802 --> 32:44,352
Okay? where H is anything in H and H prime is anything in H.

298
32:44,712 --> 32:49,252
That's what I mean. Take all all things in this set and take all products with things in this set.

299
32:49,692 --> 32:55,472
Now, how do we calculate that? Well, first of all, we rewrite this AH as HA.

300
32:55,792 --> 32:59,422
Because this set is the same as this set.

301
32:59,892 --> 33:01,042
Right?"

302
33:01,522 --> 33:05,492
Okay?"

303
33:06,132 --> 33:17,442
Now I claim that that's the same set as H A B H."

304
33:17,802 --> 33:19,422
By associativity."

305
33:19,742 --> 33:21,272
Okay?"

306
33:21,572 --> 33:30,442
I mean, this is the set of all things H a B H prime. So associate AB, it's the set of all things H, AB, H prime.

307
33:30,902 --> 33:31,902
Okay?"

308
33:32,642 --> 33:44,592
By associativity. And now I use the normality of H once again to rewrite this as AB times H times H.

309
33:45,272 --> 33:55,402
By normality, now this time with respect to the element AB, not respect to the element A. This is by normality.

310
33:55,872 --> 33:57,542
Because for any element A in G,"

311
33:57,922 --> 34:06,482
this is the case. We didn't just assume it for the unique element A. To be a normal subgroup has to be for any element.

312
34:07,212 --> 34:09,022
Okay?"

313
34:09,322 --> 34:17,372
And now we look at this and say, well, my gosh, if I take a product of anything in H times anything in H, what do I get? Something in H.

314
34:17,562 --> 34:18,552
Because H is a subgroup.

315
34:18,772 --> 34:21,672
So this is the same thing as AB times H."

316
34:22,012 --> 34:25,362
As H is a subgroup.

317
34:25,652 --> 34:32,702
And that shows that as a set, if you take the product of anything in this coset times anything in this coset, you get the elements of this coset.

318
34:33,092 --> 34:36,362
And that's what we needed for this multiplication to be well defined.

319
34:36,702 --> 34:40,952
Okay? So this is something you must go through carefully yourself.

320
34:41,472 --> 34:53,322
I can do it at the board 50 times, but the difference is taking products of sets and products of elements. This looks so good. But that's because I've got a preferential writing for this coset.

321
34:53,902 --> 34:57,622
Don't ever be deceived into thinking you have a good way of writing down a coset.

322
34:57,822 --> 34:58,822
You don't."

323
34:59,632 --> 35:00,512
Okay?"

324
35:01,202 --> 35:09,032
The integers mod n are very bizarre in that you have rather natural representatives from the cosets, the numbers from 1 to n.

325
35:09,292 --> 35:15,432
But you could have also taken the numbers from 0 to -n. What's so good about positive numbers?

326
35:15,882 --> 35:20,622
Or you could have taken you could have gone from -n/ 2 to +n/ 2.

327
35:20,822 --> 35:23,292
There are all kinds of ways you could have represented the cosets.

328
35:23,952 --> 35:30,092
And even taking the numbers from 1 to M, which looks so great, when you add two of them, you overflow and you have to go back.

329
35:30,892 --> 35:31,822
Right?"

330
35:31,992 --> 35:33,902
So you don't have natural representatives.

331
35:34,192 --> 35:38,142
And that's why this kind of beautiful looking multiplication is just wrong in general.

332
35:38,392 --> 35:43,012
However, the the miracle of normality is that it actually works out to be okay.

333
35:43,322 --> 35:58,532
It defines a group structure on g mod h with identity the coset EH and inverses AH inverse is equal to the coset A inverse H.

334
35:59,292 --> 36:02,162
So that you have to check.

335
36:02,722 --> 36:04,692
Okay?"

336
36:04,852 --> 36:05,412
So that's the answer in general."

337
36:05,692 --> 36:11,772
You can make a group structure on the set of all cosets for a subgroup if and only if H is normal.

338
36:12,662 --> 36:20,002
If and only if H is a normal subgroup.

339
36:20,552 --> 36:23,222
Otherwise, there's no natural group structure.

340
36:23,482 --> 36:31,262
There may be ways you can put a group structure on the set, but not in some natural way that reflects the addition law in G.

341
36:31,572 --> 36:39,512
Now, let's go a little further on this, because we have not only a group structure on the set of cosets, we get a natural homomorphism.

342
36:40,332 --> 36:57,992
So, if H is normal in G, get a group structure on g mod H, the quotient group and"

343
36:58,532 --> 37:18,242
a subjective group homomorphism F from G to g mod h that takes the element A into its coset.

344
37:19,372 --> 37:24,072
That's subjective because every coset is the coset of something.

345
37:24,512 --> 37:31,002
And it's a homomorphism because we've defined the group law in this way."

346
37:31,582 --> 37:45,122
And so homomorphism because f of A times f of B is the coset of ABH which is f of AB."

347
37:45,952 --> 37:48,032
Okay?"

348
37:48,392 --> 37:52,992
And one more thing, since it's subjective, we know what the image of this map is."

349
37:53,012 --> 37:57,862
What is the kernel of this map?"

350
37:58,442 --> 38:01,982
The kernel is the things that map to the identity in here.

351
38:02,322 --> 38:05,652
The identity is the coset EH."

352
38:05,952 --> 38:09,282
What elements in G map to the coset of E?

353
38:10,122 --> 38:11,482
Yeah."

354
38:11,882 --> 38:13,862
The elements of H."

355
38:14,252 --> 38:17,612
The coset of E consists of the elements in H."

356
38:17,832 --> 38:31,952
So the elements in G that map to the identity E prime f inverse of EH which is the coset H.

357
38:32,432 --> 38:39,272
And that finally is the answer to a question that was asked a week ago.

358
38:39,522 --> 38:44,632
Every group homomorphism has as its kernel a normal subgroup."

359
38:45,262 --> 38:51,232
Conversely, every normal subgroup is the kernel of a group homomorphism.

360
38:51,582 --> 38:58,282
Here it is. You have a normal subgroup. Here's a group homomorphism which exhibits it as a kernel.

361
38:58,882 --> 39:00,012
Okay?"

362
39:00,682 --> 39:03,392
Let's put that down because it's so important."

363
39:03,802 --> 39:13,702
Corry. Every

364
39:14,292 --> 39:29,372
normal subgroup H of G is the kernel of a group homomorphism."

365
39:30,222 --> 39:33,252
It's the only way to get normal subgroups."

366
39:34,092 --> 39:43,852
With image, well, yeah, is the kernel of a group homomorphism.

367
39:44,352 --> 39:45,172
Okay."

368
39:45,492 --> 39:58,032
Now, the final result I'm going to deal with today is more or less tautological, but um it's got a fancy name. It's called the first isomorphism theory of group theory."

369
39:58,402 --> 40:02,082
I don't know, these names are idiotic."

370
40:02,352 --> 40:11,502
Um, the uh fundamental theorem of algebra is not a theorem in algebra at all. It's a theorem in complex analysis.

371
40:11,772 --> 40:15,212
But never mind, we're going to skip the the the pretentiousness of this name.

372
40:15,782 --> 40:21,852
But it it's a nice result and it it somehow ties the kernels and everything we've been working together.

373
40:22,382 --> 40:27,402
All right, so this is called the isomorphism theorem. You'll see where the isomorphism is.

374
40:27,592 --> 40:34,002
It's tautological as all good theorems are, namely you've built up enough ammunition so you just kill the theorem right there.

375
40:34,592 --> 40:37,892
So we've built up enough information ammunition, just kill this.

376
40:38,212 --> 40:57,722
It says if F from G to G prime is a subjective group homomorphism with kernel H

377
40:58,322 --> 41:05,622
And here's an example of one. Here's a subjective group homomorphism with kernel H, namely the to g mod h.

378
41:05,862 --> 41:24,182
Then F induces an isomorphism which I'll call F bar from g mod h to g prime.

379
41:24,712 --> 41:27,092
Sometimes isomorphisms are denoted like that.

380
41:27,332 --> 41:34,182
So an invertible homomorphism, an isomorphism of groups.

381
41:34,432 --> 41:41,232
So, if you have a surjective homomorphism and you know the kernel, you know the image as a group.

382
41:41,502 --> 41:47,302
The image is exactly the group structure on this quotient group. You can construct the image from the kernel.

383
41:47,632 --> 41:58,002
And this map F bar of the coset AH is equal to by definition F of A.

384
41:58,252 --> 42:00,962
And you have to check that that's well defined.

385
42:01,192 --> 42:07,062
Namely that the value of F is independent on what coset representative I choose.

386
42:07,342 --> 42:18,112
But that's just because the kernel of F is H. So f of A is equal to f of A prime if A prime is another element in AH.

387
42:18,472 --> 42:20,392
That's just because H is the kernel.

388
42:20,942 --> 42:28,032
And you have to check that this is an isomorphism. So that shows that it's a well-defined map. Then you have to check that it's a group homomorphism.

389
42:28,292 --> 42:37,532
Well, that's because our our multiplication law in the quotient group is that AH BH is ABH.

390
42:38,022 --> 42:47,442
So you check that using the multiplication law on the quotient group, this is actually a homomorphism. It's subjective because the original thing was subjective.

391
42:47,632 --> 42:59,042
So if you wanted to hit something in G prime, you'd find an A in G that mapped to it because this is assumed subjective, and you take the image of that coset and you hit your element in G prime. One moment.

392
42:59,322 --> 43:13,252
And there is it has no kernel because the original well, it has a trivial kernel because the original kernel was the subgroup H, but H has been collapsed down to the identity in this group.

393
43:13,472 --> 43:20,242
So the only things that map to the identity in G prime are in the coset H, which is the identity element of this group.

394
43:20,702 --> 43:31,402
So I've got a construction that somehow collapses the kernel down and makes a new group where now I have a trivial kernel and the same essential homomorphism.

395
43:31,732 --> 43:32,842
Okay?"

396
43:33,222 --> 43:35,082
I'm sorry, I just wanted to get all that out."

397
43:35,342 --> 43:36,932
Now, let's go back and get the question.

398
43:36,932 --> 43:43,822
Okay. Um what exactly do you mean by induces an isomorphism? Namely, this map

399
43:44,512 --> 43:50,202
induce gives another group homomorphism. This is the induced homomorphism.

400
43:50,572 --> 43:58,872
It's sort of so tautological that I, you know, if this the definition of F bar follows from the definition of F. That's what I mean by induces A.

401
43:59,392 --> 44:03,832
And then the key thing is that it's an isomorphism.

402
44:04,142 --> 44:14,402
Both subjective, which the original one was, but now with trivial kernel, one to one, because I've collapsed the kernel down in this quotient group process.

403
44:14,772 --> 44:22,922
So anytime I have a subjective homomorphism, I can turn it into an isomorphism by going to the quotient group here.

404
44:23,372 --> 44:24,092
Yeah.

405
44:24,582 --> 44:30,132
This may be a silly question but can you always define um the quotient group of G?"

406
44:30,522 --> 44:38,122
We can define g mod h a quotient group on G for any subgroup that's normal. That's what we first checked.

407
44:38,672 --> 44:44,372
But the beautiful thing is that the kernel of any homomorphism is a normal subgroup.

408
44:44,892 --> 44:54,372
So from this definition, from the fact that h is normal in G, I go construct g mod h as a group.

409
44:55,262 --> 45:03,172
And then the theorem says that this map which is not an isomorphism induces an isomorphism on the quotient group.

410
45:03,642 --> 45:05,252
Okay?"

411
45:05,432 --> 45:14,132
It's not a deep result because we've we've done all the work, namely all the work is figuring out which subgroups we can associate quotient groups to.

412
45:14,412 --> 45:19,642
And what the multiplication is in the quotient group and defining a map from g to g mod h like this.

413
45:20,342 --> 45:28,182
Now Peter would say that a better way to write this is to take the original homomorphism like this,

414
45:28,642 --> 45:38,182
to construct our nice homomorphism subjective to g mod h like this where h is the kernel.

415
45:38,542 --> 45:41,982
So this would be a subjective map, right?

416
45:42,382 --> 45:46,662
So this we could construct, let's call this map capital F.

417
45:46,882 --> 45:50,632
So we construct F like this.

418
45:50,942 --> 46:04,132
And if you think about the construction of this map F bar, it just says that we can construct a map up here F bar such that the composition of these two maps is this map.

419
46:05,292 --> 46:15,882
Because this map capital F takes A to the coset AH and then F bar takes the coset AH to what F did to A.

420
46:16,522 --> 46:25,432
So Peter would say that a better way of stating the isomorphism theorem is to say that any homomorphism factors through the quotient group.

421
46:25,892 --> 46:27,582
Okay?"

422
46:28,112 --> 46:46,622
Homomorphism factors through the quotient this canonical homomorphism"

423
46:46,882 --> 46:49,122
by the kernel.

424
46:49,552 --> 47:05,262
So, not only remember that when you construct the group structure on g mod h, you're not just constructing a new group. You're constructing a new group that comes with a map. And the isomorphism theorem says that you can factor a homomorphism through that map.

425
47:06,062 --> 47:13,542
When you get on and you do category theory where the only thing you do is write down little things and arrows between them, this will be a useful way of stating it.

426
47:14,612 --> 47:21,192
Okay? But this is a good way to think about it, that you convert a homomorphism into an isomorphism by the quotient construction."

427
47:21,592 --> 47:28,062
Now I'm going to give you a little bit of notation now, um, and to give you also a little bit of warning about it.

428
47:28,062 --> 47:38,472
So I'm going to tell you what an exact sequence of groups is.

429
47:38,822 --> 47:47,432
Actually, I'm going to tell you what a short exact sequence of groups is.

430
47:47,882 --> 47:52,422
So exact sequences is a notation that comes up inological algebra.

431
47:52,722 --> 48:01,262
When you take a course in algebraic topology, you'll see a million and one exact sequences. The notation, the the actual terminology exact sequence"

432
48:01,622 --> 48:10,702
was invented by Elenberg and Mclain in the 40s after much thought as to what the heck they should call it.

433
48:11,712 --> 48:19,202
An exact short exact sequence of groups is a diagram of five groups. You start off with the identity group. That's that's called the identity group one.

434
48:19,572 --> 48:27,582
Then you have a subgroup H, then you have a group G, then you have a group G prime, and then you have another group one.

435
48:28,482 --> 48:31,882
This is a an everything in this is a group homomorphism.

436
48:32,462 --> 48:40,782
F and g are group homomorphisms.

437
48:40,982 --> 48:47,492
So are these maps. I mean, any any group assign you can always map the identity into a group, that's a group homomorphism. One goes to the identity.

438
48:47,872 --> 48:52,802
If you map everything in g prime to the identity element in this group, that's a group homomorphism too.

439
48:53,192 --> 48:54,342
Okay?"

440
48:54,862 --> 48:56,402
They're group homomorphisms."

441
48:57,272 --> 49:02,972
G of H has to be the kernel of F.

442
49:03,542 --> 49:07,342
That's what it means to be a short exact sequence of groups.

443
49:07,712 --> 49:11,712
So that it it identifies and F is subjective.

444
49:12,452 --> 49:17,552
And G is injective."

445
49:17,872 --> 49:22,722
group homomorphism. Let me write this again so I get it actually right."

446
49:23,192 --> 49:31,622
G is injective, G is 1 to one and and F is onto.

447
49:32,242 --> 49:35,402
So this is a surjection. So g prime is the image.

448
49:35,752 --> 49:40,762
This is an injection, so it identifies H with the kernel of F.

449
49:41,242 --> 49:47,202
So that G is built out of these two groups, H and G prime.

450
49:47,512 --> 49:52,692
So g prime would be identified by the way by the isomorphism theorem with g mod h.

451
49:53,122 --> 50:02,022
Because this would be a homomorphism with kernel H and image g prime. So by the isomorphism theorem, it identifies them.

452
50:02,692 --> 50:10,612
So this is a way of saying that a group is built out of two smaller objects, an image group and a kernel group.

453
50:11,282 --> 50:22,272
It's not important that you get all this now, but you're going to see it a million times. And here's the warning. Do not think that because you know H and G prime, you know G.

454
50:23,032 --> 50:24,392
Note,"

455
50:24,782 --> 50:39,652
The inputs H and G prime do not determine the group G.

456
50:40,262 --> 50:45,022
And I'm going to give you two examples of it, so you remember this for all time. Take the group,"

457
50:45,572 --> 50:48,442
the symmetric group on three letters.

458
50:48,742 --> 50:53,782
That has a normal subgroup, the alternating group on three letters.

459
50:54,322 --> 51:00,182
The quotient group is the group plus or minus one of two elements.

460
51:00,772 --> 51:06,102
The sign map. This is the sign map. This is the obvious inclusion.

461
51:06,742 --> 51:08,482
Okay?"

462
51:08,932 --> 51:10,982
That's an exact sequence of groups.

463
51:11,272 --> 51:16,402
Here's a group with six elements. The subgroup has three elements. The quotient group has two elements.

464
51:16,782 --> 51:18,102
Okay?"

465
51:18,402 --> 51:22,802
Going to write you down another exact sequence. The cyclic group of order six

466
51:23,512 --> 51:31,832
maps to the cyclic group of order two by taking a congruence mod six and just looking at it mod two.

467
51:32,312 --> 51:38,112
So the odd elements in here go to one here, and the even elements mod six go to two, go to zero.

468
51:38,502 --> 51:42,362
The kernel is the cyclic group of order three.

469
51:43,042 --> 51:45,412
That's another exact sequence.

470
51:45,782 --> 51:51,712
So this takes A to A mod 2 which is well defined.

471
51:52,482 --> 52:02,002
And this Z mod 3Z is really the elements divisible by two, 2Z mod 6Z.

472
52:02,242 --> 52:03,462
It's the same group.

473
52:03,802 --> 52:08,222
Okay, those are two exact sequences, if you think about them. There's a kernel, there's an image.

474
52:08,582 --> 52:16,632
Okay, this group is isomorphic to this group because all groups of order three are cyclic. We proved that for groups of prime order.

475
52:16,852 --> 52:17,412
Right?"

476
52:17,682 --> 52:25,002
This group is isomorphic to this group because all groups of order two are cyclic and therefore they're equal.

477
52:25,502 --> 52:32,552
But this group is not the same as this group because this is an abelian group of order six and this is non-abelian.

478
52:32,972 --> 52:37,952
So, even though you can sometimes break a group up into a subgroup and a quotient group,

479
52:38,292 --> 52:44,082
and you've learned something by decomposing it that way, the pieces at the ends do not determine necessarily the group in the middle."

480
52:44,342 --> 52:52,622
There's more information you need to put these two groups together into this group or to this group to say which one you're getting.

481
52:52,982 --> 52:54,192
Yeah."

482
52:54,592 --> 52:57,372
I'm not sure I understand what the ones are."

483
52:57,582 --> 52:59,002
Oh, those ones are just the trivial group."

484
52:59,002 --> 53:00,372
Sorry, suppose I wrote it like this."

485
53:00,732 --> 53:01,582
Yes."

486
53:01,802 --> 53:12,562
There what they mean to indicate in this exact sequence terminology is that this map is an inclusion and this map is onto. And this map is onto.

487
53:13,432 --> 53:22,092
If I could say it the following way, to say this map is an inclusion is to say that the image of this map is the kernel of the next map. That's how it comes up as an exact sequence.

488
53:22,322 --> 53:34,752
An exact sequence means the image is is the kernel of the next map. So the image of this is just E. So if that's the kernel of G, that says this map is an injection because its kernel is trivial.

489
53:35,282 --> 53:40,572
And likewise, if this map is onto, then it says that the image of this map should be the kernel of this map.

490
53:40,812 --> 53:46,872
Well, this map takes everything to the identity element. So its kernel is everything.

491
53:47,602 --> 53:52,312
But usually you don't indicate the group E, but you just write it as the group one like this.

492
53:53,662 --> 54:00,552
This is just notation that signifies that this group is built out of this subgroup and this quotient group.

493
54:01,192 --> 54:02,422
Okay?"

494
54:02,622 --> 54:07,052
But those of you who will see this in algebraic topology courses should at least see what it means in group theory.

495
54:07,292 --> 54:09,122
We're not going to use this notation."

496
54:09,382 --> 54:16,782
You can put it away. But just remember when you encounter it, that you don't get the group in the middle from the from the sub the normal subgroup and the quotient group.

497
54:17,352 --> 54:19,742
Okay. Wednesday."
