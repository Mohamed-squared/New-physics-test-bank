1
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:16,159
Exam was a difficult exam. It it was a little, I think too long.

2
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,249
Uh, the median and mean turned out to be 75% and the grades were distributed as follows.

3
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:30,399
Uh, so I think if you were in the 70s or above, you're doing fine.

4
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,419
Down here, I think you need to do a little bit of work just to practice doing these kind of problems.

5
00:00:34,419 --> 00:00:41,499
I realize we don't have time pressure on homework, and I may try to design the second hour exam to relieve a little time pressure. We'll see what we can do.

6
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:44,699
Uh, so let me just go over the questions briefly.

7
00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:50,79
I think the problem one, number of people had a difficulty with. The definition of a cyclic group

8
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:56,269
uh means there exists G is cyclic

9
01:00,139 --> 01:09,39
if there is an element g in G such that any

10
01:09,39 --> 01:15,159
or let's call this element A maybe, the generator, such that any

11
01:17,109 --> 01:19,769
g in G has the form

12
01:23,219 --> 01:24,549
g is equal to A to the N,

13
01:25,979 --> 01:28,299
some N in Z.

14
01:29,529 --> 01:32,69
So any element is some power of G.

15
01:32,549 --> 01:33,899
Such Gs are called generators.

16
01:33,899 --> 01:40,649
Do not think, and this is where people made a mistake on the second half of the problem, that any element of the group is a generator.

17
01:41,79 --> 01:49,119
That's not true. For a cyclic group of order four, the square of a generator is not a generator because it has order two.

18
01:49,789 --> 01:54,849
So, the definition of a cyclic group, there should be some generator of this form.

19
01:54,849 --> 02:00,139
And then you're supposed to prove that if H is a subgroup of G, is also cyclic.

20
02:01,869 --> 02:08,239
So what we have to find for H is a generator of H, given the fact that A is a generator for G.

21
02:08,909 --> 02:10,19
Let's write it like this.

22
02:11,189 --> 02:12,569
So there are two possibilities.

23
02:13,269 --> 02:18,599
If H is equal to the identity, then it's true.

24
02:20,79 --> 02:24,869
Because the identity group is by definition cyclic, you can take the identity element as a generator.

25
02:25,449 --> 02:25,929
If not,

26
02:30,849 --> 02:41,19
then H contains A to the N for some N bigger than one or equal to one.

27
02:42,889 --> 02:51,29
Because if it if it's not just the identity element, then it contains some power of A for some non-zero integer.

28
02:51,29 --> 02:58,799
And if it contains some non-zero integer, then by taking the inverse of that element, you can assume that it contains a power of A for some positive integer.

29
03:00,259 --> 03:03,599
Taking inverse if necessary.

30
03:05,819 --> 03:10,269
And then what you do to find a generator of H is a generator

31
03:13,869 --> 03:20,29
B of H is A to the K where K is the minimal such power.

32
03:23,999 --> 03:24,809
Such N.

33
03:25,859 --> 03:33,699
Namely, for all the positive powers of A in in that lie in H, take the smallest positive power of A that lies in H, call that thing B.

34
03:34,619 --> 03:36,579
And I claim that B generates H.

35
03:36,929 --> 03:38,19
So now you have to prove that.

36
03:38,19 --> 03:44,739
So you say, well, suppose there's something else in H, say A to the M is in H.

37
03:45,769 --> 03:50,429
So we write M as some multiple of K

38
03:50,939 --> 03:56,109
plus a remainder with zero less than or equal to R less than K.

39
03:56,869 --> 03:59,179
We use the Euclidean algorithm to write it that way.

40
03:59,829 --> 04:07,359
Since A to the M and A to the K to the Qth power are both in H,

41
04:10,569 --> 04:12,279
so is A to the R.

42
04:14,219 --> 04:16,729
But R is a positive number less than K.

43
04:17,849 --> 04:28,39
And the only positive power of A by by definition of what K is, that lies in H, or non-negative power of A that lies in H, is the zeroth power.

44
04:30,129 --> 04:31,859
That implies that R is equal to zero,

45
04:32,809 --> 04:39,969
so that M is equal to Q times K and A to the M is equal to B to the Q.

46
04:41,619 --> 04:48,249
And that shows that any element in H is a power of the smallest power of A that lies in H.

47
04:48,569 --> 04:49,809
So that H is also cyclic.

48
04:50,399 --> 04:52,819
It's not true that anything in H will be a generator.

49
04:53,339 --> 04:55,119
So that was a mistake that a lot of people made.

50
04:56,839 --> 04:57,649
Yeah, Atticus.

51
04:57,649 --> 05:05,329
When you say H contains A to the N, do you actually mean H has the element A to the N? Yeah, sorry, like that.

52
05:05,519 --> 05:06,509
Yeah, yeah.

53
05:06,929 --> 05:10,119
There's some power of A that lies in H if it's not the identity.

54
05:10,799 --> 05:11,529
All right, number two.

55
05:13,469 --> 05:20,699
So, the first thing is if H is normal, show that GH G is equal to

56
05:21,389 --> 05:22,779
Sorry, HGH, sorry.

57
05:24,959 --> 05:26,339
Is a is a left coset.

58
05:30,339 --> 05:31,119
Well, if H is normal,

59
05:31,839 --> 05:36,579
that implies for every G in G that GH is equal to HG as a set.

60
05:40,999 --> 05:43,439
That the left coset of G is the right coset of G.

61
05:43,989 --> 05:49,679
So you simply replace this HG here by

62
05:50,179 --> 05:52,659
it's the same as the set GH times H.

63
05:53,229 --> 05:59,769
But GH times H by associativity is the same thing as G times H because anything in H times anything in H lies in H.

64
06:00,289 --> 06:01,579
So that shows it's a left coset.

65
06:04,999 --> 06:07,989
And the set the third second part of this problem is a little harder.

66
06:08,569 --> 06:14,119
You're supposed to say if H is not normal, then this is not equal to GH.

67
06:14,889 --> 06:16,659
So, let's let's do it this way.

68
06:16,659 --> 06:22,749
If HGH is a left coset,

69
06:24,289 --> 06:26,319
we're going to prove that H is a normal subgroup.

70
06:26,829 --> 06:34,589
Well, if it is a left coset, it must be the coset GH.

71
06:35,619 --> 06:36,909
Because it contains that coset.

72
06:36,909 --> 06:40,679
If you take the first element in H to be the identity element,

73
06:41,609 --> 06:45,929
and you take the identity, because this is equal to E times GH.

74
06:46,329 --> 06:47,759
And E is an element in H.

75
06:48,689 --> 06:51,209
So it because it contains because

76
06:53,359 --> 06:54,449
it contains

77
06:57,359 --> 06:58,149
this set.

78
06:59,589 --> 07:01,909
So there's only one possible coset it could be.

79
07:02,869 --> 07:09,529
So, on the other hand, if, but then, so HGH has to equal the set GH.

80
07:11,249 --> 07:15,929
Now, what this means if you uh

81
07:19,19 --> 07:21,179
Mhm.

82
07:22,909 --> 07:24,319
So I claim that that means that

83
07:25,939 --> 07:28,189
if you take this right coset,

84
07:28,189 --> 07:34,239
this implies that H times G is actually contained in GH.

85
07:34,869 --> 07:39,719
Because this is a subset of this.

86
07:40,289 --> 07:43,359
Namely, this is H times G times the identity.

87
07:44,659 --> 07:48,699
So that this right coset is contained in this left coset.

88
07:50,719 --> 07:58,139
In particular, conjugating by G, G inverse HG is contained in H.

89
08:01,519 --> 08:03,209
Well, that's true for every G.

90
08:06,59 --> 08:10,859
Because this is assumed to be a left coset for all G in G.

91
08:12,259 --> 08:13,699
But that implies

92
08:15,609 --> 08:19,509
in fact that G inverse HG is equal to H

93
08:19,849 --> 08:21,19
for all G.

94
08:22,159 --> 08:33,109
Because take this identity and multiply it on the left by G and on the right by G inverse, you get H is contained in G H G inverse for all G.

95
08:35,719 --> 08:39,679
Conjugate by uh G.

96
08:40,789 --> 08:50,639
And if this is contained in this, and this is contained in this for all G, then this is contained in this, which is contained in the same thing for G replaced by G inverse, so they have to be equal.

97
08:51,289 --> 08:52,689
And this means that H is normal.

98
08:56,529 --> 09:04,719
So if this were a left coset for all G, then we've just proved that H is normal. So if it isn't normal, there has to be some G for which this isn't a left coset.

99
09:07,599 --> 09:10,569
Okay. The third problem most people got, it wasn't that hard.

100
09:10,889 --> 09:15,579
It's really a definition of what it means to be equal in a quotient group.

101
09:16,309 --> 09:17,879
So, the third problem,

102
09:19,439 --> 09:31,709
suppose if X bar commutes with Y bar in G mod N, which is G bar,

103
09:32,529 --> 09:38,629
that's just a statement that the coset XY is the same as the coset YX.

104
09:40,809 --> 09:43,69
So this is an equivalent way of stating it.

105
09:44,279 --> 09:50,269
Because this is what X bar times Y bar is as a coset, and this is what Y bar X bar is as a coset.

106
09:50,849 --> 09:54,779
But this is the same thing if you multiply, let's see how we do this.

107
09:54,779 --> 09:57,439
Let's multiply on the left by X inverse.

108
09:58,259 --> 10:02,49
YN is equal to X inverse YXN.

109
10:02,689 --> 10:10,459
And then multiply on the left by Y inverse, N is equal to Y inverse X YXN.

110
10:11,319 --> 10:15,829
And if the coset of this is the is N, that means that this is an element in N.

111
10:18,19 --> 10:18,869
Did I do this right?

112
10:19,209 --> 10:20,389
Is that what we were supposed to prove?

113
10:20,389 --> 10:22,559
Oh, I think I did it in the other way around. Sorry.

114
10:23,449 --> 10:24,429
I apologize.

115
10:24,829 --> 10:25,829
Um, let's do it again.

116
10:26,419 --> 10:32,29
So, let's instead multiply this by Y inverse.

117
10:32,529 --> 10:34,149
So I get exactly the statement that I put up.

118
10:34,599 --> 10:36,959
Apologies, I did it the wrong way. Y inverse XYN

119
10:37,659 --> 10:44,959
is equal to XN and then that's the same thing as X inverse Y inverse XYN

120
10:45,479 --> 10:51,879
is equal to N, which is the same thing as X inverse Y inverse XY is in N.

121
10:52,649 --> 10:56,209
And all these steps are reversible, so that's the that's the problem three.

122
10:56,869 --> 11:01,999
Now, this element is sometimes called the commutator of X and Y. You'll see it in the literature written that way.

123
11:04,229 --> 11:05,969
Okay. That's problem three.

124
11:06,269 --> 11:11,709
Problem four, people got the definition of the center right, but then had trouble with the rest of the problem.

125
11:12,489 --> 11:13,859
So the definition of the center

126
11:17,19 --> 11:24,299
consists of all elements Z such that ZG is equal to GZ for all G in Z.

127
11:25,159 --> 11:26,889
The things that commute with every element.

128
11:26,989 --> 11:29,769
Now, suppose you have a unique element of order two.

129
11:29,899 --> 11:30,659
First of all,

130
11:30,859 --> 11:33,99
if Z, let's say A has order two

131
11:36,449 --> 11:37,149
in G.

132
11:37,669 --> 11:42,79
Then I claim that GAJ inverse has order two.

133
11:45,559 --> 11:47,829
The conjugate of any element of order two has order two.

134
11:47,829 --> 11:51,839
In particular, in general, the conjugate of an element of order N has order N.

135
11:51,989 --> 11:55,989
Conjugation is an automorphism of the group, so it preserves everything, like order.

136
11:56,479 --> 11:58,909
Well, you can prove this rather easily. You just square the element.

137
11:58,909 --> 12:00,849
And these two things cancel,

138
12:00,849 --> 12:03,119
so you get GA squared G inverse,

139
12:03,119 --> 12:07,759
which is just G G inverse because A squared is one, which is E.

140
12:07,759 --> 12:13,559
Which shows that the square of this element is one, but this element can't be one because you can't conjugate a non-trivial element into the identity.

141
12:13,559 --> 12:17,719
So it has order two.

142
12:17,719 --> 12:21,659
Well, if it has order two and there's a unique element of order two,

143
12:21,659 --> 12:24,79
And this is what most people didn't use in the problem.

144
12:24,79 --> 12:28,639
You can't just get it out of the fact that the conjugate has order two. If A is unique,

145
12:28,639 --> 12:35,729
that implies that G A G inverse is equal to A for all G.

146
12:35,729 --> 12:41,219
Because there's another element of order two.

147
12:41,219 --> 12:43,869
Which means that GA

148
12:43,869 --> 12:46,469
is equal to AG

149
12:46,469 --> 12:48,909
for all G, which implies that A is in the center.

150
12:48,909 --> 12:52,169
This argument, by the way, is this the argument

151
12:52,169 --> 12:56,549
you can show that use to show that the conjugate of an element of order N has order N.

152
12:56,549 --> 13:04,579
Again, you multiply it N times.

153
13:04,579 --> 13:09,679
N times.

154
13:09,679 --> 13:16,669
And then you all the internal G's and G inverses cancel and you get GA to the N G inverse, which is the identity if A to the N is the identity.

155
13:16,669 --> 13:24,149
And then you can do that for all G, so that shows that it has exact order N.

156
13:24,149 --> 13:26,769
Okay.

157
13:26,769 --> 13:32,279
So this is unique. Can you have a unique element of order three? So almost everyone got that you can't because if you have an element of order three, it generates a cyclic group of order three.

158
13:32,279 --> 13:41,159
So you get a little subgroup that looks like E A A squared.

159
13:41,159 --> 13:44,239
And you find that this element also has order three.

160
13:44,239 --> 13:48,549
In fact, A squared is the same as A inverse. A and A inverse always have the same order.

161
13:48,549 --> 13:53,999
So the only way it could possibly be unique is if A is equal to A inverse, which means that A has to have order two.

162
13:53,999 --> 13:58,429
If you have an element of order four, it can't be unique. An element of order five can't be unique.

163
13:59,179 --> 14:01,609
So that's A is not equal to A squared.

164
14:02,119 --> 14:04,679
So you can't have a unique element of order three.

165
14:05,249 --> 14:06,909
But these elements frequently come up.

166
14:06,909 --> 14:09,149
We're going to see groups which have unique elements of order two.

167
14:09,149 --> 14:11,419
So you get an interesting element in the center.

168
14:11,419 --> 14:24,329
Okay. Problem four, almost everyone got.

169
14:24,329 --> 14:28,609
That was the question on uh the symmetric matrices.

170
14:28,609 --> 14:34,459
So I'll just it's it's So if A is equal to

171
14:34,459 --> 14:37,429
AIJ where AIJ is

172
14:37,429 --> 14:41,709
AJI. This is clearly closed under addition.

173
14:41,709 --> 14:48,599
And scalar multiplication.

174
14:49,609 --> 14:53,999
And uh contains the zero element, so it's a subspace.

175
14:54,999 --> 14:57,539
That was easy.

176
14:58,199 --> 15:05,969
And then the dimension isn't hard either because if you think about it, such a matrix is completely determined by the entries on the diagonal and above the diagonal.

177
15:06,589 --> 15:09,759
Once you have these entries of the matrix, they determine everything else.

178
15:10,239 --> 15:14,699
So you just have to count how many possibilities are there for matrices on the diagonal, et cetera.

179
15:14,929 --> 15:22,369
And the number of entries in this diagonal is N, and here we have N - 1 entries, and here we have N - 2 entries, all the way down to one entry.

180
15:22,849 --> 15:30,119
So the dimension is 1 + 2 + + N, which is N * N + 1 over 2.

181
15:30,549 --> 15:31,869
A little bit more than N squared.

182
15:33,889 --> 15:34,509
Okay.

183
15:35,509 --> 15:37,889
And uh problem six, most people got.

184
15:38,599 --> 15:44,119
Oh, I'm sorry. Then you had to I asked whether it was closed under multiplication. So I got all kinds of abstract arguments here.

185
15:44,359 --> 15:46,649
But all you have to do is write down an example.

186
15:47,109 --> 15:51,779
So, an example, if you do this, if you multiply this by this matrix,

187
15:52,939 --> 15:58,919
These are both symmetric matrices, but when you take the matrix product, you get this, which is not symmetric.

188
15:58,919 --> 16:00,459
Some people gave me the general 2x2

189
16:00,459 --> 16:05,49
times the general 2x2.

190
16:05,49 --> 16:08,949
They got a 2x2 matrix here and they said, well, it doesn't look equal.

191
16:08,949 --> 16:12,229
But I don't know that. I mean it's some funny combinations of A's and B's.

192
16:12,659 --> 16:14,229
You actually actually have to give me numbers.

193
16:14,489 --> 16:21,929
Other people said, well, if it were closed under multiplication, then by taking transpose, I would have AB is equal to BA

194
16:22,619 --> 16:27,929
for all elements in the group. And since we know matrix multiplication isn't commutative, then that can't happen.

195
16:28,309 --> 16:31,959
Well, we don't know that symmetric matrix multiplication isn't commutative.

196
16:32,289 --> 16:33,219
It's a picky point.

197
16:33,769 --> 16:38,689
But it's so much easier when you're trying to give a counter example to a statement, just give an example.

198
16:39,659 --> 16:40,549
Less theory.

199
16:40,549 --> 16:42,629
When you're trying to prove something, that's when you need theory.

200
16:44,159 --> 16:44,649
Okay.

201
16:45,159 --> 16:50,739
And then finally problem six, which almost everyone realized once you wrote down the bijection, it was pretty clear.

202
16:51,199 --> 16:54,209
So we had the vector space F to the N.

203
16:55,989 --> 17:02,969
And we want to give a a bijection between the set of bases and uh GLNF.

204
17:02,969 --> 17:07,39
So first of all, most people forgot the first part of the problem to actually define this group.

205
17:07,309 --> 17:08,899
I didn't take too much off.

206
17:09,259 --> 17:14,759
But this is going to be the set of A which are N by N matrices

207
17:15,939 --> 17:24,49
with entries in F and determinant of A not equal to zero under multiplication.

208
17:24,49 --> 17:28,999
That's the definition of the group.

209
17:28,999 --> 17:32,19
GLNF.

210
17:32,19 --> 17:53,849
And we want a map between bases and elements in GLNF and the the idea is if you take a basis, an ordered basis V1 VN, and you define F of that basis to be the matrix where the first column is the entries of V1 and the second column is the entries of V2, and the last column is the entries of VN.

211
17:54,269 --> 17:56,109
That gives you an N by N matrix.

212
17:56,619 --> 18:07,649
Since these elements are linearly independent, because it's a basis, these columns are linearly independent, so that that people could quote, shows that the determinant of the matrix is non-zero.

213
18:07,909 --> 18:11,219
So that's a map between bases and elements in GLNF.

214
18:11,649 --> 18:21,749
It's clearly a one-to-one map because if if you know what the matrix is, you know all the entries of the basis, so you know the basis. No two bases would go to the same matrix.

215
18:22,129 --> 18:29,119
And it's onto because if I take any invertible matrix and I just can take the the first column is my first basis vector in FN.

216
18:29,669 --> 18:38,689
And the second column is my second basis vector. The fact that the matrix is invertible says that the elements, these N elements are linearly independent, so give a basis.

217
18:40,139 --> 18:41,579
That was all I needed for that.

218
18:42,109 --> 18:48,859
Now, for those of you who tried the last one, and there were one or two people who tried it, I'm not sure anyone, one or two people got it.

219
18:49,929 --> 18:52,629
You use this problem to do it. That's the best way to do it.

220
18:52,629 --> 19:03,49
Namely to to calculate the order of the group GLN of Z mod PZ, you have to calculate

221
19:03,49 --> 19:10,229
the number of ordered bases of Z mod PZ to the Nth power.

222
19:12,119 --> 19:14,689
Well, why would that be any easier than calculating this?

223
19:14,689 --> 19:15,829
Well, let's try to make a basis.

224
19:15,829 --> 19:18,839
The first thing we have to do is choose our first basis vector.

225
19:19,529 --> 19:28,709
So that can that's got to be a vector in this space and the only thing it has to be is linearly independent from zero. We're going to build a basis by keeping adding linearly independent elements.

226
19:30,439 --> 19:37,79
So the first thing is just some non-zero vector in there and there are P to the N minus one choices for that first vector.

227
19:38,739 --> 19:41,709
Right? Because there are P to the N vectors here and only one is zero.

228
19:42,169 --> 19:51,559
And then if we're going to make the we have to choose a basis vector V2, we want it linearly independent from V1.

229
19:52,129 --> 19:54,799
IE not on the line spanned by V1.

230
19:54,799 --> 20:00,739
So there are P to the N total vectors in here and there are P vectors on the line spanned by V1.

231
20:00,739 --> 20:04,229
So there are P to the N minus P choices for V2.

232
20:04,789 --> 20:10,679
And then if we want to choose V3, it better be linearly independent from the plane spanned by V1 and V2.

233
20:11,289 --> 20:19,49
And there are P to the N minus P squared choices for the vector V3 because there are P to the N vectors total and these are the number of vectors in the plane spanned by V1 and V2.

234
20:19,49 --> 20:27,729
We keep going down and the last best vector is P to the N minus P to the N minus 1.

235
20:28,279 --> 20:34,249
So the total number of bases is the product of this number of choices times this number of choices times this times this.

236
20:34,899 --> 20:45,429
So it's P to the N minus 1, sorry, P to the N minus 1, P to the N minus P down to P to the N minus P to the N minus 1.

237
20:45,829 --> 21:00,759
And if you factor out all the powers of P you get, you get P to the N times N minus 1 over 2 times P to the N minus 1 P to the N minus 1 minus 1 down to P minus 1.

238
21:01,679 --> 21:14,319
So, in particular, if you wanted to do the order of the finite group GL2 over Z mod P, 2x2 invertible matrices, it would be P times P squared minus 1 times P minus 1.

239
21:17,149 --> 21:18,959
We're going to come back to this finite group later.

240
21:18,959 --> 21:19,699
It's an important group to do.

241
21:19,699 --> 21:31,439
And the best way to count its order is to use this bijection of sets, namely to forget that it's a group and to think of it as counting the number of ways of assembling a basis of this vector space.

242
21:32,499 --> 21:37,509
There was no extra credit given for that, but I thought you might find it amusing if you had time. Nobody had any time.

243
21:38,349 --> 21:44,369
So I will try to, as I say, construct the next exam so that it not only tests the material, but gives you enough time to think about it.

244
21:44,479 --> 21:50,649
Many many people complain that they just were sort of too frazzled and I know the feeling. I'm very slow myself.

245
21:50,809 --> 21:53,409
So, uh I will try to set it up.

246
21:54,89 --> 21:55,219
Questions about this?

247
21:56,379 --> 22:00,699
Do not get discouraged. I don't think anybody in the course is seriously lost. This is all a process of learning a language.

248
22:00,699 --> 22:07,769
If you're, as I say, if you're if you're in this range, you're doing fine. If you're down here, I think you need a little bit more practice.

249
22:10,519 --> 22:11,429
Okay.

250
22:11,429 --> 22:12,539
Now we're going to get started.

251
22:12,539 --> 22:26,599
And we're going to with the linear algebra that we have at our disposal, we're going to go back and construct some very interesting groups and start to study a beautiful relationship that was discovered at the end of the 19th century between group theory and geometry.

252
22:27,429 --> 22:31,239
Almost all of geometry is now formulated in terms of group theory.

253
22:31,759 --> 22:40,599
Many of you may have been reading in the popular science press, some mathematicians and astronomers have come up with a model for the shape of the universe.

254
22:40,829 --> 22:42,839
It's all based on group theory, based on a dodecahedron.

255
22:43,169 --> 22:46,219
The universe is a soccer ball.

256
22:46,569 --> 22:47,739
Um anyhow, uh

257
22:48,739 --> 23:02,979
I don't actually believe their model and I think that when they look at a little bit more data that's come in from the from the um from the various radio uh uh telescopes that are orbiting that they'll contradict it, but it's an interesting uh hypothesis.

258
23:02,979 --> 23:05,679
Do you think the universe looks like a dodecahedron?

259
23:06,9 --> 23:11,679
Yeah, that it's finite and that you should be able to look out in this direction and see something that you saw back in that direction.

260
23:11,949 --> 23:12,829
Yeah, if you look on the

261
23:13,579 --> 23:14,999
Do they really believe it? Yeah, it was an article

262
23:15,289 --> 23:17,209
There's an article No, no, no, no.

263
23:17,469 --> 23:22,299
Kepler had this wonderful model where Yeah, but Kepler also believed for all of his

264
23:22,299 --> 23:32,159
for all of his science, he believed that the the solar system was organized by inscribing platonic solids into other platonic solids.

265
23:32,379 --> 23:34,659
I mean, there was there was a lot of mysticism back then.

266
23:34,899 --> 23:42,599
So mathematicians still believe that there should be some very simple three-dimensional geometric shape that describes a finite universe.

267
23:42,769 --> 23:46,769
And the astronomers keep coming up with data that contradict this. But never mind their data.

268
23:46,769 --> 23:52,929
Um, so if you look on the cover of, I believe Nature, which in which the article is published this month, there's a description of it.

269
23:52,929 --> 23:54,859
I know the guy who wrote the article, Bill Meeks.

270
23:54,989 --> 23:56,739
He's been proposing this for some time.

271
23:57,119 --> 24:03,589
And they're just getting enough um they're just getting enough data from all these orbiting satellites to actually test it.

272
24:04,319 --> 24:04,719
Okay.

273
24:05,369 --> 24:09,439
Now, we have this group that I called GLN of F for any field.

274
24:09,899 --> 24:18,989
Now we're going to define a very interesting subgroup of it, which I'm going to call ON of F. And then we're going to define a subgroup of that, which I'm going to call SON of F.

275
24:19,259 --> 24:24,659
And that works for any field and we're going to show that they have some interesting matrices in it.

276
24:24,909 --> 24:31,639
And then we're going to take a look at this when F is equal to R,

277
24:33,709 --> 24:35,839
it's related to geometry, in fact, Euclidean geometry.

278
24:35,839 --> 24:39,579
This group, by the way,

279
24:39,579 --> 24:42,219
this sometimes is called the general linear group.

280
24:42,219 --> 24:51,609
These are called the orthogonal groups. That's why the O.

281
24:52,119 --> 24:54,869
And this SO stands for special orthogonal group. You'll see what that is.

282
24:55,289 --> 25:01,759
That's a normal subgroup of the orthogonal group. And in fact, the index is two, so it's rather simple.

283
25:02,249 --> 25:04,669
Okay, so here's the definition of this group.

284
25:05,79 --> 25:13,19
The first thing we do is we take our vector space V, which is F to the N. And this group is just the linear maps from V to V which are isomorphisms.

285
25:13,629 --> 25:21,779
So we're going to get a subgroup by putting some more structure on V, some more structure, and then just looking at the subgroup that preserves that structure.

286
25:22,269 --> 25:29,669
So we put additional structure on V and the structure we're going to put on it is an inner product.

287
25:29,669 --> 25:38,709
We're going to take two vectors and give you an a scalar.

288
25:40,39 --> 25:45,109
Uh when you take courses in calculus, these things are called inner products. More generally, they're called bilinear forms.

289
25:45,109 --> 25:51,39
All right.

290
25:51,39 --> 25:55,729
So we're going to define an extra thing then that that takes two vectors and coughs up a scalar.

291
25:55,889 --> 25:56,689
And here's the definition.

292
25:57,79 --> 26:02,469
The vector itself is an N-tuple of elements in F.

293
26:03,589 --> 26:06,659
And the vector W is an N-tuple of elements in F.

294
26:08,909 --> 26:17,609
And the definition of this inner product is what you did in calculus. A1 B1 + A2 B2 + + AN BN.

295
26:17,969 --> 26:21,769
So it's some weird form of the product.

296
26:22,179 --> 26:27,129
You take the product of the first two elements, then you add it to the product of the second two elements, then you add it to the product of the third. If we were just in a one-dimensional vector space, it would be the product.

297
26:27,479 --> 26:33,609
It just be A1 times B1. Okay.

298
26:36,199 --> 26:53,709
And we define ON to be the elements A in GLNF that preserve the inner product such that when you take the inner product of AV with AW, it's the same as the inner product of V with W.

299
26:54,399 --> 26:56,579
That looks like a weird thing to do.

300
26:57,109 --> 26:58,789
But I claim that this is a subgroup.

301
26:58,789 --> 27:03,189
So everyone AV means you apply the matrix A to the vector V and you get another vector.

302
27:03,189 --> 27:08,189
You multiply, right?

303
27:08,189 --> 27:19,19
So this would really be A times V transpose if you really wanted to write it that way. I mean, to get a to get a But but I I want everyone understands what I mean by AV.

304
27:19,19 --> 27:29,249
This is the vector, you know, A times V transpose transpose, something like that. Right? You line up the vector, you multiply it by may and then you you straighten it out again.

305
27:29,699 --> 27:30,299
Okay.

306
27:30,489 --> 27:31,649
So, uh why is this a subgroup?

307
27:31,649 --> 27:38,79
Well, because if I have if I have it certainly contains the identity element.

308
27:38,79 --> 27:45,749
If it contains A and B, is it is it true that AB

309
27:45,749 --> 27:55,729
of V AB of W, is that equal to VW?

310
27:55,729 --> 27:58,539
Well, let's see.

311
27:58,539 --> 28:06,909
This is A of BV A of BW

312
28:07,629 --> 28:11,639
because matrix multiplication is composition of operators.

313
28:12,139 --> 28:25,759
Now, this is by since A is in the orthogonal group, this is the inner product of B BV with BW because if we apply A to any vectors, we don't change their inner product. And then since B is in the orthogonal group, this is the inner product of V with W.

314
28:26,719 --> 28:30,639
So, if A and B are both in the orthogonal group, so is their product.

315
28:31,79 --> 28:32,789
And I'll let you check inverse.

316
28:32,789 --> 28:33,629
It's no harder.

317
28:33,629 --> 28:37,39
Also

318
28:38,549 --> 28:45,29
A inverse is in O of O of uh ON of F.

319
28:47,189 --> 28:51,469
All right. Now let's figure out what this means in terms of what the matrix looks like.

320
28:51,469 --> 28:57,139
Now remember what the matrix looks like is this.

321
28:57,139 --> 29:01,319
The matrix A has first column

322
29:01,319 --> 29:09,149
what the operator A does to the vector A of the vector 1 0 0.

323
29:09,879 --> 29:16,129
And the second column of A is what A does to the vector 0 1 0 0.

324
29:16,599 --> 29:22,159
And the last column of it is what A does to the vector 0 0 0 1.

325
29:22,159 --> 29:30,449
Because this this vector space has a standard basis and the standard basis we'll call E1

326
29:31,449 --> 29:42,339
which looks like 1 0 0 0 0 down to EN equals 0 0 1 in the Nth place. That's the standard basis of this vector space.

327
29:42,339 --> 29:47,139
And you get you turn a matrix into an operator by seeing what it does to the standard basis.

328
29:48,139 --> 29:54,419
Okay. Now the standard basis has the following property. If you take the inner product of E1 with itself, you get one.

329
29:54,909 --> 29:58,739
If you take the inner product of E2 with itself, you get one.

330
29:58,739 --> 30:03,639
If you take the inner product of EN with itself, you get one.

331
30:04,119 --> 30:04,439
Right?

332
30:04,919 --> 30:12,629
Because these only have one one in them and uh if you take if you look at this formula, only one term is non-zero and it's one times one.

333
30:13,149 --> 30:22,539
On the other hand, if you take the inner product of EI with EJ and I is not equal to J, you get zero.

334
30:22,539 --> 30:32,319
Because EI has a one in the Ith place and EJ has a one in the Jth place and they never you get zeros in all these terms.

335
30:32,319 --> 30:34,939
So,

336
30:36,369 --> 30:42,729
that has to be true for these column vectors too because they we preserve the inner product. That's the definition of what it means to be in the orthogonal group.

337
30:42,729 --> 30:49,689
So if you take the inner product of this column with itself, you have to get one.

338
30:49,989 --> 30:56,189
And the inner product of this column with itself, you have to get one because that's the same as the inner product of E2 with E2.

339
30:57,199 --> 30:57,719
All right?

340
30:57,969 --> 31:02,189
What is the inner product of this column with itself look like? Well, it's this element squared plus this element squared plus this element squared, right?

341
31:02,189 --> 31:06,149
The inner product of this column with this column is this element times this element, this element times this element, this element times this element, this element.

342
31:06,149 --> 31:12,239
Okay?

343
31:12,879 --> 31:16,179
Now, we can rewrite that in the following way.

344
31:17,159 --> 31:39,629
This implies that the inner product of A E I A E J equals product of inner product of Ith and Jth columns equals 1 if I is equal to J and 0 if I is not equal to J.

345
31:40,599 --> 31:42,779
Okay. Now let's rewrite what this means.

346
31:42,779 --> 31:47,559
This is this is N squared different numbers that we know.

347
31:48,279 --> 31:52,299
N numbers we know are equal to 1 and a lot of numbers we know are equal to 0.

348
31:52,829 --> 32:01,199
I claim that this is the same thing as saying that if you take the transpose of the matrix A and you multiply it by the matrix A, you get the identity matrix.

349
32:01,199 --> 32:04,659
Well, let's see why that would be the case.

350
32:04,659 --> 32:07,139
Suppose we took the transpose of the matrix A.

351
32:07,139 --> 32:11,649
The first row of that is A of 1 0 0 0.

352
32:11,649 --> 32:17,379
Right? Because the first row of the transpose is the first column here.

353
32:17,379 --> 32:18,559
All right?

354
32:18,559 --> 32:23,169
Now let's multiply let's calculate the first entry in A transpose A.

355
32:23,169 --> 32:25,859
Let's calculate this entry up here.

356
32:25,859 --> 32:31,269
We go across the first row of A transpose, we go down the first column of A, and we add up.

357
32:31,269 --> 32:33,949
Well, that's just the inner product of this column with itself.

358
32:34,339 --> 32:36,509
And we agreed that was one.

359
32:36,909 --> 32:39,139
So the first entry here is a one.

360
32:39,139 --> 32:44,699
Let's calculate this entry here. The entry in the first row, second column.

361
32:44,699 --> 32:49,219
We'd go across the first row here and we'd go down the second column here.

362
32:49,599 --> 33:02,689
Well, that would be the inner product of this column with this column, which we agreed was zero. So we get a zero.

363
33:03,189 --> 33:06,369
Etc. You get zeros all here. Then when you did this row, you'd get a one there.

364
33:06,369 --> 33:09,439
And you'd see that this matrix product times this is the identity.

365
33:09,439 --> 33:13,219
That's just another way of rewriting that the columns have this property.

366
33:13,219 --> 33:17,329
So, we see that if we have a matrix in GLN

367
33:17,329 --> 33:26,289
which preserves the inner product, then the product of the the transpose of the matrix by A is the identity.

368
33:26,289 --> 33:32,39
Which is the same thing as saying that the transpose of A is the inverse of A.

369
33:32,39 --> 33:40,529
So it's also true in the other direction. A times A transpose is the identity.

370
33:40,529 --> 33:42,779
Okay.

371
33:42,779 --> 33:52,769
Conversely, I claim that if we have a matrix such that the product of its transpose times the matrix is the identity or the matrix transpose is its inverse, then it gives a transformation that preserves the inner product.

372
33:52,769 --> 33:54,859
Why? Well, this is quite tricky.

373
33:54,859 --> 33:55,579
So let's see.

374
33:56,429 --> 34:00,69
Well, first of all, I'm going to rewrite the inner product VW as a matrix product.

375
34:00,509 --> 34:06,179
It's just the transpose of the vector V times the vector W.

376
34:06,589 --> 34:08,979
Where this becomes a column vector and this becomes a row vector.

377
34:09,479 --> 34:12,359
I mean, if you think of it, that's exactly what the inner product is. If you tried to multiply

378
34:13,239 --> 34:14,749
Whoops. Other way around, huh?

379
34:16,649 --> 34:22,669
I want No, I want a row vector and column vector. Sorry. Let's try it this way.

380
34:22,869 --> 34:25,659
And hope I don't get totally screwed up here, but we'll see.

381
34:26,359 --> 34:30,149
So we write the vector V like this, we write the vector W like this.

382
34:30,449 --> 34:37,759
We go across this row and down this column, we multiply the first entry times the first entry, we multiply the second entry times the second entry, the third entry by the third entry.

383
34:37,999 --> 34:40,549
That's exactly what we're doing when we're taking the inner product.

384
34:0,929 --> 34:42,599
So this is a matrix product.

385
34:42,599 --> 34:47,949
Okay.

386
34:47,949 --> 34:50,929
Now, on the other hand, let's see if we can compute AV AW.

387
34:50,929 --> 34:55,59
Ah.

388
34:55,59 --> 34:57,139
Okay, so AV,

389
34:57,139 --> 35:02,39
oh God, this is going to be a real nightmare because I've written my vectors as

390
35:02,39 --> 35:04,629
Never mind, I'm going to let's go back.

391
35:04,979 --> 35:09,289
Let's write our vectors as column vectors so I don't actually kill myself here.

392
35:09,689 --> 35:13,529
So this would then be V transpose times W.

393
35:13,869 --> 35:16,109
Where I thought of the vectors as column vectors.

394
35:16,109 --> 35:24,89
I now know why I want to do that because then AV

395
35:24,89 --> 35:28,799
this this vector is just the matrix A times the column vector V.

396
35:29,129 --> 35:33,619
And this vector is just the matrix A times the column vector W.

397
35:34,69 --> 35:50,439
And consequently the inner product would be you'd calculate this vector, you'd transpose it and then you'd multiply it by this vector.

398
35:51,159 --> 35:52,799
As matrix multiplication.

399
35:52,799 --> 35:58,499
This is all matrix multiplication. A A times V transpose then.

400
35:58,499 --> 36:07,119
Now, if you know about transpose, that reverses the order of matrix multiplication, so this becomes V transpose A transpose A W.

401
36:07,769 --> 36:12,979
And if we assume that A has its transpose is equal to its inverse, this is the vector V transpose times the identity matrix

402
36:13,439 --> 36:18,869
size N times the vector W. The identity matrix takes any vector to itself.

403
36:19,229 --> 36:25,59
So this becomes V transpose times W, which is the same as VW.

404
36:25,59 --> 36:29,439
That's why I want to take my vectors to be column vectors.

405
36:29,439 --> 36:32,249
Just so I don't have to write transpose eight million times.

406
36:32,249 --> 36:35,889
If I take vectors to be column vectors, this is just A times V.

407
36:35,889 --> 36:41,599
So, in other words, this can also be written as the set of A in GLNF such that A transpose is equal to A inverse.

408
36:41,599 --> 36:43,539
Okay.

409
36:43,539 --> 36:45,239
Now,

410
36:46,299 --> 36:54,539
I'm going to show you a number of interesting things that happen with these matrices. For example, the first thing is that the determinant is not arbitrary.

411
36:54,539 --> 36:59,99
I claim that the determinant of A has to be plus or minus one.

412
36:59,99 --> 37:05,959
Because if you take the determinant on this identity, you get the determinant of A transpose times the determinant of A is one.

413
37:06,539 --> 37:09,529
The determinant of A transpose is the same as the determinant of A.

414
37:09,899 --> 37:14,209
So the determinant of A squared is one, so the determinant of A has to be plus or minus one.

415
37:14,549 --> 37:17,79
Of course, these things might be equal in the field.

416
37:17,79 --> 37:18,969
I want you to recognize that.

417
37:19,259 --> 37:22,529
I mean, if we had the field of two elements, they would be equal, but at least it's a plus or minus one.

418
37:22,529 --> 37:24,99
It's square is one.

419
37:24,99 --> 37:25,879
Okay.

420
37:26,429 --> 37:31,509
So, um you might ask, do we get both determinants in our group?

421
37:31,509 --> 37:34,79
Uh and the answer is yes.

422
37:34,469 --> 37:38,739
So to do that, you have to actually exhibit elements in this group.

423
37:39,159 --> 37:43,609
So I'll show you some elements which happen to preserve the inner product.

424
37:43,859 --> 37:45,409
And maybe the only thing in the group is one.

425
37:45,909 --> 37:54,49
But if you take this matrix, for example, any matrix that looks like plus or minus ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere, that's an element in ON of F.

426
37:54,49 --> 38:01,489
Because if you calculate its inverse, it's it's equal to its its inverse and it's also equal to its transpose.

427
38:01,489 --> 38:02,179
Yeah.

428
38:02,179 --> 38:06,819
So is every matrix in um in GLN also in ON? No.

429
38:06,819 --> 38:11,249
No, no, because if the sum Okay. It this is just a necessary condition.

430
38:11,569 --> 38:16,299
It's not that every matrix with determinant one is in ON, but any matrix in ON has determinant plus or minus one.

431
38:16,669 --> 38:22,99
So these are examples of matrices in ON of F. They're rather stupid because not only is the inverse equal to the transpose, but they're equal to the original matrix.

432
38:22,449 --> 38:28,169
And in particular, if you took the matrix that looked like this, -1 +1 +1 down the diagonal,

433
38:28,889 --> 38:32,149
you'd find the determinant of this is equal to -1.

434
38:32,469 --> 38:35,119
So you can have both determinants plus one and minus one.

435
38:35,649 --> 38:40,89
In particular, you get a subgroup where the determinant is plus one. That's this group.

436
38:40,89 --> 38:40,379
A in ONF

437
38:40,379 --> 38:40,669
such that the determinant of A

438
38:40,669 --> 38:43,119
is equal to +1.

439
38:43,119 --> 38:51,719
And that's a group of index two because if you think of the determinant as a homomorphism, you get a homomorphism, the determinant to the group of order two, plus or minus one, which is onto because you have things of both determinant one and plus or minus one.

440
38:51,719 --> 38:56,129
It's a homomorphism because the determinant of AB is the determinant of A

441
38:56,129 --> 38:58,989
times the determinant of B.

442
38:58,989 --> 39:00,519
And this group is just its kernel.

443
39:00,519 --> 39:04,979
And the kernel, we know by the isomorphism theorem,

444
39:04,979 --> 39:09,819
the index of the kernel, the quotient group is the image. The image is plus or minus one.

445
39:10,109 --> 39:17,859
So there are exactly two cosets of this group in this group, and uh the kernel is a normal subgroup.

446
39:18,299 --> 39:22,829
And the cosets are the elements of determinant one, that's this, and the non-trivial coset, namely this times SON.

447
39:22,829 --> 39:24,489
What other elements are in ONS?

448
39:24,489 --> 39:26,459
Well, I claim

449
39:26,459 --> 39:31,309
the permutation matrices

450
39:33,559 --> 39:36,959
are in ON of F.

451
39:37,899 --> 40:04,679
And this gives injective uh homomorphism F from the symmetric group on N letters into ON of F, no kernel, and that takes the subgroup which is the alternating group on N letters into SON of F.

452
40:04,679 --> 40:06,879
I better assume that um

453
40:06,879 --> 40:17,779
two is not equal to one is not equal to minus one in F.

454
40:18,329 --> 40:22,559
Um for this. I I should have said that. This subgroup

455
40:23,79 --> 40:32,759
if if one is equal to minus one in F, I if F is equal to Z mod 2, 1 is equal to -1.

456
40:32,979 --> 40:42,899
Then there then this homomorphism is not surjective. It only maps to um +1.

457
40:43,139 --> 40:46,709
And so ON and SON are the same group. So if I really want to get a different group,

458
40:47,79 --> 40:50,489
the index of two, that's if one is not equal to -1.

459
40:51,719 --> 40:55,419
So the permutation matrices I claim are orthogonal matrices.

460
40:55,419 --> 41:00,549
Why? They have exactly one one in each column and the rest are zeros.

461
41:00,759 --> 41:13,339
Therefore, if you think of it in terms of uh this thing, they preserve the inner product on the basis elements, namely the the columns are of of inner product with themselves one and inner product with the other column zero.

462
41:14,479 --> 41:15,509
Yeah.

463
41:15,969 --> 41:20,359
Um would you mind just explaining the connection with the isomorphism theorem Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.

464
41:20,359 --> 41:24,859
We have a homomorphism if let's assume that one is not minus one.

465
41:24,859 --> 41:33,89
So we have two elements plus or minus one. This is a subgroup of of the of the multiplicative group of F.

466
41:33,319 --> 41:35,739
The determinant maps these matrices into this group.

467
41:36,129 --> 41:40,819
It's a homomorphism because the determinant of a product of a matrices is the product of the determinants.

468
41:41,249 --> 41:45,189
It's onto because we've exhibited a specific element in the orthogonal group whose determinant is minus one.

469
41:45,189 --> 41:48,959
Okay, so you have to show that there. Here's an element of determinant minus one and the determinant of the identity is one.

470
41:49,419 --> 42:00,59
So, our isomorphism theorem says that the quotient group by the kernel is isomorphic to the image of the homomorphism.

471
42:00,489 --> 42:04,659
The kernel is by definition this group.

472
42:04,899 --> 42:08,829
That's the definition of it. The things that Those are just things that The the one, the identity element in this group.

473
42:09,119 --> 42:13,999
And therefore the quotient group has order two, and therefore they're two cosets, so the index is two.

474
42:13,999 --> 42:14,439
Okay.

475
42:15,619 --> 42:26,799
So we're going to pick up on Monday all the geometry we get by looking at Euclidean geometry from the point of view of this group, and it's going to be a completely different point of view.

476
42:26,799 --> 42:29,739
Here's a problem for you to just think about.

477
42:30,469 --> 42:34,329
We saw that these elements, these elements were in the orthogonal group.

478
42:34,729 --> 42:43,869
Prove that if you have an element in the orthogonal group and it's an and it has an eigen vector, then the eigen value is plus or minus one.

479
42:43,869 --> 42:48,769
Namely, the only things that could be on the diagonal are plus or minus one.

480
42:48,769 --> 42:49,169
