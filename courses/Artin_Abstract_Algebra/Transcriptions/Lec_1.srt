1
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:14,379
for this course. We may have others.
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,939
He did it last year as a pro at this.
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:18,269
You're a senior this year, Peter?
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:20,529
Okay. He knows everything about it.
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:28,319
Now, I want to explain how the course is going to be given because uh I have too many responsibilities this year
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:30,969
uh beyond just teaching in the math department.
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:33,699
So I have to frequently go out on the road uh and
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:40,229
so at those times Peter Green will substitute for me as a lecturer and in fact, he'll lecture for you on Friday.
00:00:40,669 --> 00:00:47,569
So you get an idea of his penetrating and lucid style of presentation before you have to decide whether you want to choose the course.
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:52,829
I would imagine that Peter will be lecturing for me one out of every four or five lectures.
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,539
But I don't know exactly when they're going to be now because I don't have my exact schedule.
00:00:58,859 --> 01:00:919
The way we're going to organize the course
00:01:01,99 --> 01:05,999
is that the textbook is going to be this nice algebra text by Mike Artin.
00:01:06,559 --> 01:08,869
So this is quite an advanced algebra text.
01:08,869 --> 01:14,809
I think it can be used profitably by students here and by students at MIT for whom it was written.
01:15,129 --> 01:24,849
Mike Artin is a senior uh guy in the MIT math department, one of the leading algebraists and algebraic geometers of the last 50 years.
01:24,989 --> 01:36,949
When you get further on, you'll learn about his work in the Artin representability theorem and you'll learn about his work with Grothendieck in settling the uh the foundations of of modern algebraic geometry.
01:37,179 --> 01:43,269
In any case, he wrote this book in mind to show really how algebra interacts with a lot of other subjects.
01:43,269 --> 01:48,209
And uh that's really the way it it does later in mathematics and I think it's a great viewpoint here.
01:48,209 --> 01:50,279
I think you'll find it a challenging text.
01:50,679 --> 01:58,779
By the way, Mike's father was Emil Artin, who was the greatest number theorist of the 20th century, invented the subject called class field theory.
01:59,259 --> 02:03,19
So he comes from a distinguished uh distinguished mathematical tradition.
02:03,529 --> 02:08,249
Um I think we're going to do homework assignments every class.
02:08,609 --> 02:12,319
Now I know most of you are coming out. What what is the background one should have for this? Everyone wants to know that.
02:12,789 --> 02:18,109
So, if you've come out of 23 or 25 or 55,
02:18,639 --> 02:19,109
you're fine.
02:19,379 --> 02:22,49
That you you clearly have the background to take this course.
02:22,309 --> 02:29,839
If you've been through 21 and you felt comfortable with the linear algebra in 21B, because I'm going to need some of that.
02:30,669 --> 02:35,99
And you you are willing to move to a slightly more abstract level of knowledge,
02:35,689 --> 02:36,459
this is good.
02:36,739 --> 02:42,979
Otherwise, I would suggest taking a course like a 121 or a 101 to get to that level of abstraction.
02:42,979 --> 02:46,849
But if you're coming out of 23, 25, or 55, it's fine.
02:47,159 --> 02:56,19
I know that those courses had weekly assignments and big long weekly assignments where everyone would devote all of Thursday night or all of Sunday night to finishing the assignment.
02:56,439 --> 03:03,89
I want to do it more on a every every lecture there'll be some assignments to keep people up to date.
03:03,89 --> 03:10,779
And the reason is that unlike 25 or 55 or or 23, taking an algebra course is like learning a new language.
03:11,289 --> 03:14,329
Algebra is really more of a language of modern mathematics.
03:14,329 --> 03:17,649
The way mathematics organizes itself and speaks to itself.
03:17,959 --> 03:24,519
And so when you learn a new language, you have to go to language lab a lot, you have to do a lot of keeping up and practicing.
03:24,749 --> 03:26,359
That's the way I've got it organized now.
03:26,599 --> 03:31,339
Peter is even going to arrange for some assignments due Wednesday and Friday.
03:31,599 --> 03:33,569
Those are optional assignments, right?
03:33,569 --> 03:35,269
Are they available now on the web page?
03:35,269 --> 03:35,659
Not yet.
03:35,929 --> 03:37,689
They will be available on the web page.
03:37,979 --> 03:51,369
Those are optional assignments, highly recommended so you can check whether you understood what I said today, but also to give you an idea of what the level of homework is going to be, so you can assess how much work there's going to be for the course before you decide to take it or not.
03:51,799 --> 03:56,569
And then once we get to Friday, we'll just start doing regular assignments due Monday and Wednesday and Friday.
03:56,569 --> 04:05,949
We'll also organize problem sessions, probably on Tuesday and Thursday once we get our CA situation straightened out and find out how many people are in the course and when they're free.
04:06,329 --> 04:08,709
But we're not going to do that um right now.
04:09,849 --> 04:11,719
There'll be two-hour exams in the course.
04:12,139 --> 04:21,719
Those weeks are marked on the web page. We're going to get a full syllabus up on the web page so you see exactly what date you're going to have the hour exam and there'll be a three-hour final in January.
04:23,159 --> 04:26,669
Questions in general before I start actually talking about the math in the course?
04:28,969 --> 04:29,559
That was easy.
04:29,559 --> 04:29,889
Okay.
04:30,569 --> 04:32,579
So what are we going to use from linear algebra?
04:32,719 --> 04:39,279
Well, if you want to review your linear algebra in a nice way, it's done in chapter one of this book.
04:39,279 --> 04:46,209
And I'm going to go through it and just tell you what we need from it so you can go back and find out what you remember and what you don't remember, etc.
04:46,829 --> 04:53,409
Um, because we need some linear algebra initially to generate examples of groups, which are the first topic of the course.
04:53,869 --> 04:59,439
And the linear algebra we're going to need all concerns the set of all n by n matrices.
05:00,49 --> 05:02,909
where n and n is the same number, so square matrices.
05:06,529 --> 05:11,529
Now, the entries of the matrix, if you're if you're in the ith row and you're in the jth column,
05:12,29 --> 05:13,479
the entry would be Aij.
05:13,479 --> 05:15,319
That that'll be the notation I'll use.
05:15,669 --> 05:21,269
So the first row looks like A11, A12, up to A1n.
05:22,99 --> 05:26,269
And then we have An1 down here all the way over to Ann.
05:27,519 --> 05:30,19
The entries of a matrix are numbers.
05:30,199 --> 05:34,159
That's what Artin says in the beginning. And they can be numbers in various different places.
05:34,579 --> 05:41,909
But before we get into the theory of rings or vector spaces or abstract fields, I'm going to take the entries all just to be real numbers.
05:45,59 --> 05:50,169
And the set of all n by n matrices, I'm going to denote M n R.
05:51,599 --> 05:54,69
So that's all collections of n by n matrices.
05:54,579 --> 06:06,239
So those of you who have studied linear algebra know that that's a vector space over the real numbers, it has dimension n squared because you have you have a basis for that vector space of the matrices that have zeros everywhere but a one in the ith jth place.
06:08,29 --> 06:13,679
So in particular, as a vector space, you can do a number of things in this in this uh set.
06:13,929 --> 06:16,89
For example, you can add matrices,
06:16,749 --> 06:17,799
A + B.
06:17,979 --> 06:24,129
So if you have a matrix where the entries are Aij and you have a matrix where the entries are Bij,
06:24,619 --> 06:28,999
then the sum of these two matrices has entries Aij + Bij.
06:30,329 --> 06:32,939
So you just add the elements in the ijth place.
06:32,939 --> 06:37,609
That's the addition law in the vector space of n by n matrices.
06:37,609 --> 06:40,519
And you can also multiply matrices by a real scalar.
06:40,819 --> 06:45,609
If you have a a real number alpha and you have an n by n matrix Aij,
06:46,149 --> 06:51,759
then you can multiply alpha times A and get the matrix where the entries are alpha times Aij.
06:51,759 --> 06:53,709
Namely, multiply every member by alpha.
06:54,109 --> 06:57,99
That's the scalar multiplication in the vector space.
06:57,479 --> 07:5,779
So that's what makes this a a real vector space of dimension n squared.
07:6,129 --> 07:8,649
As I say, you have to write down a basis, that's not difficult.
07:8,719 --> 07:12,999
Now, what's unusual, that would be true for n by m matrices too.
07:13,269 --> 07:18,369
You can add them, you can multiply them by scalars and the dimension is m times n.
07:19,439 --> 07:27,309
What's unusual about n by n matrices is not just that you can add them or multiply them by scalars, but that you can multiply them.
07:28,429 --> 07:31,619
So that's another thing I'm going to ask you to remember from linear algebra.
07:31,619 --> 07:32,479
Is it okay if I erase this?
07:32,479 --> 07:40,959
Because of the video setup today, which didn't know whether I was going to be using this or the blackboard, I have to stay somewhat on the left side of the board.
07:41,289 --> 07:42,119
With your apologies.
07:42,369 --> 07:45,999
So all that wonderful space, I'm aware of it, but I'm not going to use it.
07:46,519 --> 07:47,79
Okay?
07:47,239 --> 07:48,699
Is this okay the way I am?
07:48,699 --> 07:49,279
Good.
07:50,919 --> 07:56,359
Okay, so that's a a big thing about n by n matrices is that there's a multiplication,
08:04,609 --> 08:10,949
which is a fairly complicated operation. Namely, if you have two matrices A and B, you can define a new matrix A times B.
08:16,459 --> 08:25,619
So, uh those of you who've studied this since uh 10th grade, know that the uh if this has entries Cij,
08:26,859 --> 08:31,699
then you get the ijth entry of Cij in the following manner.
08:31,699 --> 08:34,409
You go across the ith column of A, ith row of A,
08:34,659 --> 08:37,849
you go down the jth column of B,
08:37,849 --> 08:41,849
you multiply this element by this element, then you multiply this element by this element and add those,
08:41,849 --> 08:43,879
you multiply and you add up.
08:44,349 --> 08:53,639
So the formula in mathematics, although it's not that useful, is the sum over K of uh what? Aik times Bkj.
08:55,529 --> 09:2,409
And you might wonder what the heck is that mean, but it certainly defines given two n by n matrices, a third.
09:4,179 --> 09:5,419
The matrix multiplication.
09:5,889 --> 09:18,269
Now, when you study linear algebra right, and we will review linear algebra done right, you get a little bit away, you step back from the theory of matrices and you see what matrices represent.
09:19,29 --> 09:22,179
And what matrices represent are linear operators.
09:22,589 --> 09:29,989
So in particular, this is the set of linear operators from an n-dimensional real vector space to itself.
09:31,759 --> 09:37,19
Every matrix is some a way of writing down a specific linear transformation.
09:37,359 --> 09:40,469
We'll do that later on, but it's good thing to bear in mind.
09:40,869 --> 09:51,349
Because if you understand that a matrix represents a linear transformation, then what multiplication of matrices represents is the composition of transformations.
10:0,979 --> 10:5,919
That's not obvious from this formula at all. You have to you have to unwind a million things to see that.
10:6,719 --> 10:12,419
So if A represents the transformation that of T from Rn to Rn,
10:14,999 --> 10:20,19
and B represents the transmit let's see, I'll do uh B first and A second.
10:20,629 --> 10:24,199
And B represents a transformation S from Rn to Rn,
10:24,799 --> 10:30,549
represented by B, and remind yourself how this works, and that's done in Artin too.
10:33,729 --> 10:44,189
Then the product, first do B, then do A, represents the composition of the transformations, first take the transformation S and compose it with the transformation T.
10:45,789 --> 10:55,879
Now, one thing that we emphasize a lot when you study linear algebra is that that may not be equal to first doing the transformation T and then doing the transformation S.
10:56,829 --> 11:5,919
So remember, and this is really important, that it is true that if you add A to B, it's the same as B to A.
11:5,919 --> 11:12,739
That's just the commutativity of the laws of addition, because matrix addition just takes place coordinate by coordinate.
11:12,739 --> 11:13,219
But
11:14,429 --> 11:24,309
it is not necessarily true that A times B is equal to B times A.
11:24,639 --> 11:27,949
There are examples where this is not equal.
11:28,309 --> 11:32,999
So the only way to really convince you of that is to write down a specific example.
11:33,209 --> 11:36,859
So I will write down a specific example for you, which Artin uses.
11:37,179 --> 11:45,889
If you multiply this matrix, you have to go to 2 by 2 matrices because multiplication of 1 by 1 matrices is just multiplication of real numbers.
11:46,449 --> 11:49,489
Right? I mean if if n is this is k goes from 1 to n.
11:49,809 --> 11:58,489
So if n is equal to 1, this is just you get this matrix by taking the product of the entry in A by the product of the entry in B. And multiplication of real numbers is commutative.
11:58,829 --> 12:2,229
But if you go to 2 by 2 matrices, it's no longer the case.
12:2,539 --> 12:7,749
So for example, if you multiply this matrix by this matrix,
12:9,249 --> 12:18,79
you'll find that the only non-zero entry you get is when you go across this row and down this column, right? So that would be an entry up here.
12:18,749 --> 12:21,139
And all the other entries you find to be zero.
12:22,439 --> 12:24,439
On the other hand, whoops, did I just do that wrong?
12:24,989 --> 12:30,729
Uh yeah, it should be, sorry, the last row, the top row and the yeah.
12:33,309 --> 12:34,689
They're all zero? No.
12:35,449 --> 12:36,679
0, 1.
12:37,609 --> 12:44,439
So if I go across this row and that column, I get a one, but in all the other cases, the one is multiplied by zero and I get zero.
12:44,739 --> 12:50,619
Let's try it in the other direction, see if I got this right. This would be typical where I work this example out wrong.
12:50,949 --> 12:54,519
So that's this matrix here, then this one goes up here.
12:55,949 --> 12:58,409
Are there any places where we get a non-zero entry here?
12:58,409 --> 13:2,939
This is zero, this is zero, this is zero, and this is zero.
13:2,939 --> 13:4,669
So this turns out to be the zero matrix.
13:6,399 --> 13:11,309
So, this is the product of A and B, this is the product of B and A. These matrices are clearly different.
13:12,209 --> 13:14,889
By the way, this matrix I'll just call the zero matrix.
13:15,249 --> 13:17,519
It's the zero element of the vector space.
13:17,519 --> 13:22,919
It's whatever, it's the element of the vector space such that when you add it to an arbitrary vector, you get the vector back.
13:23,539 --> 13:24,809
Because you're not changing anything.
13:25,289 --> 13:33,569
The matrix that looks like this, 1 1 1 1 1 all down the diagonal and zero elsewhere, I'll call that the the identity matrix.
13:35,349 --> 13:37,519
That's a distinguished matrix.
13:37,839 --> 13:45,169
And that has the property, if you work out this addition this multiplication law, that if you multiply anything by the identity matrix, you get it back.
13:45,649 --> 13:48,509
So um, I'm running out of room here, let's go here.
13:53,209 --> 14:1,589
So 0 + A is equal to A + 0 is equal to A. And no matter which side you multiply by the identity matrix, sorry, is I times A,
14:4,649 --> 14:11,629
sorry, this is, yeah, this is A, if you add zero, and if you multiply by I, you get A.
14:12,309 --> 14:15,379
So you have a multiplicative identity and an additive identity.
14:17,719 --> 14:23,99
Okay, some other laws of matrix multiplication uh and addition.
14:23,359 --> 14:26,999
For example, you have the distributive law and you have the associative law.
14:26,999 --> 14:37,729
So the distributive law says if you multiply A times B + C, it's the same as multiplying A by B and then adding the product of A by C.
14:37,729 --> 14:49,939
And the associative law, which is the most important, is that if you multiply A times B times C and you first multiply B times C and then times A, that's the same thing as multiplying A by B and then multiplying by C.
14:50,909 --> 14:58,419
So the normal laws of arithmetic, addition and multiplication, all hold except for the commutativity of multiplication.
14:59,489 --> 15:2,219
Now, you might ask, how do I prove something like this?
15:2,739 --> 15:7,179
Well, it's truly hideous if you try to do it with this formula for the matrix product.
15:7,859 --> 15:15,259
You know, but if you think of it in terms of composition of transformations, these are three different transformations. There's an S, T, and maybe an R.
15:17,129 --> 15:20,99
Mhm, or U, let's call it U for a transformation.
15:21,739 --> 15:30,59
And to do A composed with B and C would be first compose S with U and then compose with T.
15:30,759 --> 15:40,49
And to do this would be first compose U with S, uh sorry, S with T and then compose with U. But all all two ways of doing it are just giving you the composed
15:40,499 --> 15:53,249
transformation where you take U and then you take S and then you take T. Namely, the the effect of this on any given vector in Rn is to calculate T of S of U of V.
15:54,299 --> 15:55,459
No matter which way you do it.
15:55,779 --> 16:4,789
So if you think of it in terms of composition of transformations, this associative law is more or less clear. Same thing you can think of the distributive law if you want to.
16:5,99 --> 16:19,59
Uh, in any case, the way this was proved in the original world of linear algebra before people understood linear algebra uh linear transformations was just by computing with this formula, which as I say, is not the most pleasant thing to do.
16:20,819 --> 16:21,199
Okay.
16:21,659 --> 16:27,369
So these are what I want you to remember about multiplication and addition of n by m matrices.
16:27,659 --> 16:32,649
And as I say, it's all reviewed in chapter one, but I'm not going to go over that. I'm going to assume you've seen this.
16:32,649 --> 16:34,29
Have most of you seen this material?
16:36,429 --> 16:36,779
No.
16:36,929 --> 16:39,889
How many have not seen anything about n by n matrices? I'm just amused.
16:39,889 --> 16:41,309
Don't be embarrassed. I got to know.
16:41,839 --> 16:42,189
Okay.
16:44,549 --> 16:49,419
Now, a much trickier thing about n by n matrices is the question of inversion.
16:50,539 --> 16:57,559
So we say A is invertible, an n by n matrix,
16:58,969 --> 17:12,659
if and only if there exists a matrix B with the property that when you multiply on either side by B, you get to the identity matrix.
17:16,859 --> 17:22,939
So the it requires the existence of a second matrix.
17:23,789 --> 17:26,619
Now, invertibility is a tricky business.
17:27,639 --> 17:29,269
It's a tricky business in matrix theory.
17:29,269 --> 17:31,219
Not every matrix is invertible.
17:31,219 --> 17:36,429
For example, the zero matrix is never invertible because if you multiply any matrix by zero,
17:38,699 --> 17:39,999
you get zero.
17:41,349 --> 17:46,919
If you have zeros in all entries, no matter what the entries of A are, when you compute the matrix product, you get zero.
17:47,509 --> 17:53,939
So there's no way I could find another matrix to multiply by zero to get the identity, because any product with zero is zero.
17:53,939 --> 17:57,599
So, example, zero, I is invertible.
17:58,369 --> 17:59,519
There's a good case.
18:0,439 --> 18:3,619
You take B is equal to I.
18:4,589 --> 18:7,499
And zero is not invertible.
18:11,749 --> 18:14,209
But between those two, it's it's a tricky business.
18:14,209 --> 18:19,779
For example, for 1 by 1 matrices, it's an easy answer, but already for 2 by 2, it's quite complicated.
18:20,219 --> 18:22,569
So for 1 by 1 matrices,
18:27,289 --> 18:29,389
So the matrix just looks like A,
18:30,369 --> 18:37,459
uh is invertible if and only if A is not equal to zero.
18:38,109 --> 18:43,779
And then the inverse matrix is just given by the entry 1 over A.
18:44,69 --> 18:49,369
That's the only thing you could multiply A by and get to the identity matrix, which is just the the the thing one.
18:49,779 --> 18:53,339
So a real number is invertible if and only if it's non-zero.
18:54,439 --> 18:55,789
For 2 by 2 matrices,
19:0,59 --> 19:10,429
it turns out to be is invertible, I'll just give you the answer, if and only if a certain quantity is non-zero,
19:11,19 --> 19:17,669
namely if you take the product of A by D and you subtract off the quantity BC is not equal to zero.
19:18,799 --> 19:24,629
And in fact, if that's the case, I'll write down the inverse matrix for you.
19:24,949 --> 19:31,729
Usually, if you you don't want to just know if a matrix is invertible or not, you want to know what its inverse is. So if this is A,
19:33,649 --> 19:43,539
then A inverse is equal to 1 over AD - BC, and you can write that real number down because this number was non-zero, so it has an inverse,
19:43,539 --> 19:50,319
times the matrix D - B - C A.
19:52,389 --> 19:56,669
And this means you take the scalar product of this matrix by that real number.
19:57,429 --> 19:58,579
So we can check that.
19:58,909 --> 20:2,939
We ought to do at least one matrix multiplication in class to see that I can do it.
20:3,689 --> 20:11,849
So let's multiply the matrix ABCD by the matrix D - B - C and A.
20:12,679 --> 20:13,719
Okay, the entry here.
20:15,679 --> 20:18,489
I go across this row and down this column.
20:18,719 --> 20:20,669
I get AD - BC.
20:23,669 --> 20:24,399
The entry here.
20:24,839 --> 20:27,879
- AB + AB.
20:27,879 --> 20:29,309
So the entry here is zero.
20:30,579 --> 20:31,169
The entry here.
20:31,579 --> 20:33,749
I go across this row and down this column.
20:33,749 --> 20:35,479
CD - CD.
20:35,919 --> 20:36,329
Zero.
20:36,809 --> 20:43,559
And the entry here, I go across this row and here I get - BC + AD, same thing, AD - BC.
20:46,709 --> 20:53,259
So if I just took this matrix, I can multiply by my matrix and get something which isn't the identity, but looks pretty close to the identity.
20:53,259 --> 20:55,339
Namely, it's a scalar multiple of the identity.
20:55,339 --> 21:1,729
And the only problem might be that this scalar might be zero.
21:1,729 --> 21:9,119
But if this scalar is non-zero, then I could have taken this matrix and multiplied by one over it, and I would get the identity.
21:9,699 --> 21:10,389
Okay?
21:11,729 --> 21:17,529
Now, in general, the answer to the question of whether a matrix is invertible or not is the following.
21:18,79 --> 21:27,199
There's a certain function from the set of n by n matrices to the real numbers called the determinant,
21:27,879 --> 21:36,499
which I'll write just det, which maps n by n matrices over the reals to the real numbers.
21:37,119 --> 21:43,889
And the determinant of a matrix is a polynomial in its entries. It's a polynomial of degree n in its entries.
21:45,
21:46,139 --> 21:50,679
So, for example, this is the determinant of the 2 by 2 matrix A.
21:51,529 --> 22:19,199
And you probably know the formula for the determinant of a 3 by 3 matrix or even generally the formula for the determinant of an n by n matrix. It's it's given by a formula, determinant of A is sum over n factorial terms with a plus or minus one in front of it, and then products of of n matrix entries.
22:20,479 --> 22:30,349
So n factorial, here is just two terms, but if you go to a 3 by 3 matrix, there are six terms in the determinant expression. 4 by 4, there are 24 terms. In short, it's a useless formula.
22:30,889 --> 22:35,339
Because once you get to 10 by 10 matrices, you don't want to be dealing with 10 factorial terms.
22:36,499 --> 22:38,759
Nonetheless, there is such a formula.
22:38,989 --> 23:0,109
And the the the key fact is A is invertible if and only if the determinant of A as a real number is not equal to zero,
23:0,109 --> 23:0,769
in which case there's a formula for the the inverse of A.
23:2,569 --> 23:17,139
And the formula looks very much like this formula. The formula then looks like you get, in fact, there's always a matrix, there is an unique matrix, that means there exists a unique matrix B such that AB is equal to BA is equal to the determinant of A times the identity matrix.
23:17,539 --> 23:18,719
There's always such a matrix.
23:18,999 --> 23:28,799
You can't always multiply something to get to the identity, but you can always find a unique matrix where the product is the determinant of A times the identity matrix.
23:28,799 --> 23:39,389
Well, no, I shouldn't say unique. I mean, if A were the zero matrix, then then anything would work. So sorry, there exists a there's a natural matrix. Let me just say that.
23:39,709 --> 23:49,69
And that B is sometimes called the matrix of cofactors, and you get its entries by taking partial determinants around A. Have you all seen that once or twice? So this is this is the matrix, for example, of cofactors of the original 2 by 2 matrix A.
23:49,699 --> 23:56,509
So there's always a matrix you can find where you multiply to get the determinant, and if this is non-zero, you divide B by the determinant and you found a matrix to multiply through to get the identity.
23:57,99 --> 24:2,299
Okay, so now I can make my first important definition in this course.
24:2,299 --> 24:3,739
So this vector space of n by n matrices is not what we're really interested in.
24:3,739 --> 24:7,849
We're interested in a subset that I'm going to call GLN of R,
24:8,359 --> 24:12,349
which is a subset of all n by n matrices over R.
24:12,739 --> 24:19,309
And this subset consists of all matrices A such that the determinant of A is not equal to zero.
24:19,309 --> 24:25,369
Or equivalently, A such that there is an inverse
24:30,139 --> 24:32,209
matrix A inverse.
24:33,79 --> 24:39,49
So for 1 by 1 matrices, the the set is everything but the zero matrix.
24:39,499 --> 24:42,519
But for 2 by 2 matrices, you have to throw away other matrices.
24:42,519 --> 24:45,249
For example, you have to throw away that matrix that we wrote down before like this.
24:45,729 --> 24:50,569
This is not in GL2 because its determinant is 0 * 0 - 1 * 0, which is 0.
24:50,949 --> 25:2,749
So this is a large set of n by n matrices.
25:2,749 --> 25:5,949
It's defined by the non-vanishing of a certain polynomial on this set.
25:5,949 --> 25:9,49
So almost everything's in it, but we just want to look at that set of matrices, the invertible ones.
25:9,499 --> 25:11,749
By the way, if an inverse exists, it's unique.
25:12,269 --> 25:14,809
Let's write that, let's prove that for ourselves.
25:16,389 --> 25:20,49
This again is all in Artin's chapter one.
25:25,479 --> 25:31,449
Exists, it is unique. So one can talk about the inverse of a matrix.
25:31,449 --> 25:33,199
There can't be two different matrices that serve as an inverse for a matrix.
25:33,199 --> 25:36,319
And the reason is the following. Suppose we had two inverses.
25:36,319 --> 25:38,949
So suppose I could say AB is equal to AC
25:39,399 --> 25:40,999
and it's also equal to I.
25:41,369 --> 25:42,209
Suppose that were the case.
25:42,859 --> 25:44,669
And I want to show B is equal to C.
25:44,669 --> 25:49,989
Well, remember that what an inverse is defined to be is not just a right inverse under multiplication, but a left inverse under multiplication.
25:49,989 --> 25:54,519
So if I took this thing and I multiplied on the left by any matrix that inverts A, for example, B,
25:54,829 --> 25:57,409
I could say, well, this implies that BAB
25:58,69 --> 25:59,249
is equal to BAC.
26:0,409 --> 26:1,469
And then I use the associative law to reassociate things.
26:1,469 --> 26:5,189
This on the other hand is BA times B,
26:5,649 --> 26:7,299
and this is BA times C.
26:7,299 --> 26:11,389
And since B was assumed to be an inverse for A,
26:11,389 --> 26:16,569
this is equal to the identity times B, and this is equal to the identity times C.
26:16,569 --> 26:20,99
And the identity times any matrix is itself, and therefore B has to equal C.
26:20,449 --> 26:25,799
So even though this matrix here doesn't have to be unique, as I said, if A were the zero matrix, any matrix B would work here.
26:26,269 --> 26:32,329
However, if you use the canonical one, the matrix of cofactors, and the determinant turns out to be non-zero so that you can divide by it, then that inverse is in fact unique.
26:32,779 --> 26:36,139
And so I should add that. There is an inverse matrix A inverse
26:37,239 --> 26:38,589
which is unique.
26:40,279 --> 26:43,909
All right, now let's look at the properties of this subset of uh
26:44,309 --> 26:48,429
the n by n matrices, because we gain things and we lose things.
26:51,829 --> 26:54,479
One thing that we lose right away
26:56,99 --> 26:57,739
is addition.
26:58,129 --> 27:1,789
There is no addition defined on the set GLNR.
27:1,789 --> 27:2,129
If you
27:2,129 --> 27:6,819
I mean, you even know that for one by one matrices,
27:6,819 --> 27:11,709
you could take a the matrix one and you could add it to the matrix minus one and both of those are invertible
27:12,19 --> 27:13,699
and their sum is the matrix zero which isn't invertible.
27:13,699 --> 27:14,559
So there's no addition law.
27:14,559 --> 27:14,819
So we lose the vector space,
27:14,819 --> 27:15,139
plus
27:15,139 --> 27:15,319
or
27:15,319 --> 27:18,889
scalar multiplication by zero.
27:18,889 --> 27:20,819
If you took a nice invertible matrix and you multiplied it by the zero scalar,
27:20,819 --> 27:21,229
you'd get down to zero which is not invertible.
27:21,229 --> 27:21,739
So forget about addition.
27:21,739 --> 27:21,979
However,
27:22,619 --> 27:25,989
the beautiful thing is that it's closed under multiplication.
27:26,229 --> 27:26,479
So I'll give you two proofs of that.
27:26,479 --> 27:26,659
Yeah,
27:26,659 --> 27:26,929
Peter,
27:26,929 --> 27:27,289
did you have a question?
27:27,289 --> 27:27,629
You're just stretching.
27:27,629 --> 27:28,119
Anyone else need to stretch?
27:28,119 --> 27:28,339
Here's
27:28,339 --> 27:30,459
here's a principle I like to do in my lectures.
27:30,459 --> 27:33,239
So, uh since it's a principle, um it'll apply.
27:33,859 --> 27:37,209
Um I go pretty fast
27:37,559 --> 27:40,619
and when nobody's stopping me, my tendency is to go faster.
27:40,929 --> 27:45,339
So, if you find yourself getting a minute behind, and then two minutes behind, and then three minutes behind in your notes,
27:45,339 --> 27:47,39
it's not a profitable experience
27:47,39 --> 27:49,699
because all you're doing is writing down gibberish which you're going to have to decipher later on.
27:49,699 --> 27:50,699
Much better that you're with me when I'm talking about it.
27:50,699 --> 27:51,979
So, the principle is that anyone can ask
27:51,979 --> 27:53,279
for a minute or two of silence.
27:53,279 --> 27:55,539
This may may not be repeated 30 times in the course of a lecture.
27:55,799 --> 27:56,549
But if you feel
27:56,549 --> 28:0,819
that you need two minutes to just catch up to what I've said on the board and digest it so that you can even ask me a meaningful question,
28:0,819 --> 28:2,249
you may just raise your hand and ask for some silence.
28:2,249 --> 28:2,479
Believe me,
28:2,479 --> 28:3,899
the other people in the class will appreciate it.
28:3,899 --> 28:4,289
And if you're confused,
28:4,289 --> 28:5,739
undoubtedly someone else is confused.
28:5,739 --> 28:6,419
So I've said something either too fast
28:6,419 --> 28:7,69
or incorrect.
28:7,259 --> 28:8,619
And I will make mistakes. That's why Peter's here.
28:8,619 --> 28:8,829
But he may miss it too.
28:8,829 --> 28:9,219
Okay.
28:9,219 --> 28:9,449
It's closed under multiplication.
28:9,449 --> 28:9,759
I'll give you two proofs.
28:9,759 --> 28:10,139
Here's the first proof.
28:10,139 --> 28:10,419
Suppose
28:10,419 --> 28:11,439
A and B are invertible.
28:11,439 --> 28:11,709
I have to prove
28:11,709 --> 28:12,129
that the product
28:12,129 --> 28:12,499
A times B
28:12,499 --> 28:12,799
is invertible.
28:12,799 --> 28:13,139
Well,
28:13,139 --> 28:13,349
to
28:13,349 --> 28:13,669
to prove something's invertible,
28:13,669 --> 28:13,919
I just have to find
28:13,919 --> 28:14,229
an inverse for it.
28:14,229 --> 28:14,409
Can someone suggest
28:14,409 --> 28:14,819
what would be a nice
28:14,819 --> 28:15,499
left inverse for it?
28:15,689 --> 28:15,849
Go ahead.
28:15,849 --> 28:16,59
Yes.
28:16,59 --> 28:17,239
B to the minus one.
28:17,239 --> 28:17,649
Yeah,
28:17,649 --> 28:17,929
B - 1 A inverse exists.
28:17,929 --> 28:18,149
So call this
28:18,149 --> 28:18,319
consider
28:18,319 --> 28:18,639
this product.
28:18,639 --> 28:18,889
And
28:18,889 --> 28:19,249
let's multiply
28:19,249 --> 28:19,469
it on the left
28:19,469 --> 28:19,879
times AB.
28:19,879 --> 28:20,309
So I have
28:20,309 --> 28:20,539
B inverse
28:20,539 --> 28:20,919
A inverse.
28:20,919 --> 28:21,399
This is the way it's associated,
28:21,399 --> 28:21,749
times
28:21,749 --> 28:22,69
AB.
28:22,69 --> 28:22,319
Now
28:22,319 --> 28:22,549
once you have
28:22,549 --> 28:22,809
the associative
28:22,809 --> 28:23,159
law for three
28:23,159 --> 28:23,509
for three
28:23,509 --> 28:23,779
products,
28:23,779 --> 28:24,149
you can reassociate
28:24,149 --> 28:24,589
for any number of products.
28:24,589 --> 28:24,819
That's
28:24,819 --> 28:25,109
a nice fact
28:25,109 --> 28:25,459
of about the associative
28:25,459 --> 28:25,729
law. So this
28:25,729 --> 28:25,979
can be written
28:25,979 --> 28:26,329
as B inverse
28:26,329 --> 28:28,329
times A inverse A times B.
28:28,329 --> 28:28,509
Which
28:28,509 --> 28:29,39
is B inverse
28:29,39 --> 28:30,359
times the identity matrix
28:30,359 --> 28:30,719
times B.
28:30,719 --> 28:31,79
Because
28:31,79 --> 28:31,319
A A inverse,
28:31,319 --> 28:31,679
A was invertible,
28:31,679 --> 28:32,209
so there's an identity
28:32,209 --> 28:32,509
matrix.
28:32,509 --> 28:32,789
And then
28:32,789 --> 28:33,139
the identity
28:33,139 --> 28:33,449
commutes with
28:33,449 --> 28:33,719
any matrix
28:33,719 --> 28:34,89
and so this B inverse I
28:34,89 --> 28:34,819
is I B inverse,
28:34,819 --> 28:35,509
so this is I
28:35,509 --> 28:35,809
times B inverse B.
28:35,809 --> 28:36,139
And then
28:36,139 --> 28:36,489
I associate
28:36,489 --> 28:36,939
these two together
28:36,939 --> 28:37,549
to get I times I
28:37,549 --> 28:37,739
which
28:37,739 --> 28:38,19
is the identity.
28:38,19 --> 28:38,409
So namely,
28:38,409 --> 28:38,939
this is the inverse.
28:38,939 --> 28:39,149
Notice
28:39,149 --> 28:39,479
that I have to take
28:39,479 --> 28:39,749
them in the opposite
28:39,749 --> 28:40,199
order. The inverse
28:40,199 --> 28:40,539
is not
28:40,539 --> 28:40,939
A inverse
28:40,939 --> 28:41,289
times B inverse,
28:41,289 --> 28:41,599
but B
28:41,599 --> 28:41,839
and then
28:41,839 --> 28:42,149
similarly,
28:42,149 --> 28:42,489
if you multiply
28:42,489 --> 28:42,859
on the right
28:42,859 --> 28:43,179
by this,
28:43,179 --> 28:43,439
first you multiply
28:43,439 --> 28:43,879
the B times B inverse,
28:43,879 --> 28:44,199
that cancels,
28:44,199 --> 28:44,519
then you multiply
28:44,519 --> 28:45,369
the A times A inverse.
28:45,369 --> 28:45,599
So that's the first proof.
28:45,599 --> 28:45,859
Suppose
28:45,859 --> 28:46,129
we took this
28:46,129 --> 28:46,479
definition
28:46,479 --> 28:46,849
of invertible.
28:46,849 --> 28:47,79
So we'd have to say
28:47,79 --> 28:47,529
that if we had
28:47,529 --> 28:47,829
two matrices,
28:47,829 --> 28:48,169
each of which
28:48,169 --> 28:48,599
had a non-zero
28:48,599 --> 28:48,939
determinant,
28:48,939 --> 28:49,569
their product
28:49,569 --> 28:49,879
had a non-zero
28:49,879 --> 28:50,219
determinant.
28:50,219 --> 28:50,469
That's what we're saying,
28:50,469 --> 28:50,769
right?
28:50,769 --> 28:51,59
If that previous
28:51,59 --> 28:51,529
condition
28:51,529 --> 28:51,819
for invertibility
28:51,819 --> 28:52,299
really worked,
28:52,299 --> 28:52,599
just being a non-zero
28:52,599 --> 28:52,989
determinant.
28:52,989 --> 28:53,329
How would we check
28:53,329 --> 28:53,599
that? That if
28:53,599 --> 28:53,869
two matrices
28:53,869 --> 28:54,249
had a non-zero
28:54,249 --> 28:54,579
determinant,
28:54,579 --> 28:54,909
their product
28:54,909 --> 28:55,229
had a non-zero
28:55,229 --> 28:55,579
determinant.
28:55,579 --> 28:55,909
Someone else?
28:55,909 --> 28:56,119
Yeah.
28:56,119 --> 28:56,399
We know
28:56,399 --> 28:56,679
from algebra
28:56,679 --> 28:56,939
that
28:56,939 --> 28:57,219
that A times
28:57,219 --> 28:57,599
that B is
28:57,599 --> 28:57,899
that AB.
28:57,899 --> 28:58,119
Exactly.
28:58,119 --> 28:58,379
So
28:58,379 --> 28:58,579
if you
28:58,579 --> 28:58,929
another
28:58,929 --> 28:59,229
this is the first
28:59,229 --> 28:59,489
proof,
28:59,489 --> 28:59,799
and the second
28:59,799 --> 30:00,179
proof is there's a famous
30:00,179 --> 30:00,559
identity
30:00,559 --> 30:00,949
for determinants
30:00,949 --> 30:01,399
that the determinant
30:01,399 --> 30:01,829
of a product
30:01,829 --> 30:02,319
of two matrices
30:02,319 --> 30:02,649
is the product
30:02,649 --> 30:03,249
of the determinants.
30:03,249 --> 30:03,509
Again,
30:03,509 --> 30:03,829
you can never prove
30:03,829 --> 30:04,809
that using
30:04,809 --> 30:05,289
the definition
30:05,289 --> 30:05,669
of determinant
30:05,669 --> 30:06,79
as the sum of n factorial
30:06,79 --> 30:07,59
terms,
30:07,59 --> 30:07,339
but we'll see how to prove
30:07,339 --> 30:07,739
that intelligently
30:07,739 --> 30:08,149
in a while.
30:08,149 --> 30:08,449
Now,
30:08,449 --> 30:08,709
if you know
30:08,709 --> 30:09,9
this,
30:09,9 --> 30:09,459
and each of these
30:09,459 --> 30:09,819
numbers
30:09,819 --> 30:10,159
are non-zero,
30:10,159 --> 30:10,549
the product of
30:10,549 --> 30:10,829
two non-zero
30:10,829 --> 30:11,239
real numbers
30:11,239 --> 30:11,569
is a non-zero
30:11,569 --> 30:11,919
real number.
30:11,919 --> 30:12,159
So
30:12,159 --> 30:12,399
then for
30:12,399 --> 30:12,699
this set
30:12,699 --> 30:13,139
is closed
30:13,139 --> 30:13,459
under multiplication.
30:13,459 --> 30:13,749
Exactly.
30:13,749 --> 30:13,939
What can we say
30:13,939 --> 30:14,209
about the multiplication
30:14,209 --> 30:14,959
on this set?
30:15,739 --> 30:16,89
Well,
30:16,89 --> 30:16,359
it has the following
30:16,359 --> 30:16,809
properties.
30:16,809 --> 30:16,989
Can I erase
30:16,989 --> 30:17,339
this now, guys?
30:17,339 --> 30:17,569
Normally I'll be using
30:17,569 --> 30:17,879
more board. We'll
30:17,879 --> 30:18,129
be set up
30:18,129 --> 30:18,449
a little bit better
30:18,449 --> 30:18,819
next time.
30:18,819 --> 30:19,79
It's closed
30:19,79 --> 30:19,619
under multiplication.
30:19,619 --> 30:19,819
Has
30:19,819 --> 30:20,149
a multiplicative
30:20,149 --> 30:20,739
identity
30:20,739 --> 30:20,989
which is the matrix
30:20,989 --> 30:21,299
I.
30:21,299 --> 30:21,499
I times
30:21,499 --> 30:21,809
anything
30:21,809 --> 30:22,219
is the
30:22,219 --> 30:22,449
something
30:22,449 --> 30:22,749
times I
30:22,749 --> 30:23,59
is itself.
30:23,59 --> 30:23,279
Uh
30:23,279 --> 30:23,469
has
30:23,469 --> 30:23,729
multiplicative
30:23,729 --> 30:24,359
inverses.
30:24,359 --> 30:24,589
A inverse,
30:24,589 --> 30:24,889
because
30:24,889 --> 30:25,259
that's how the set
30:25,259 --> 30:25,609
was defined.
30:25,609 --> 30:26,179
It's exactly
30:26,179 --> 30:26,529
the set of matrices
30:26,529 --> 30:27,29
that have a multiplicative
30:27,29 --> 30:27,569
inverse.
30:27,569 --> 30:28,139
So anything
30:28,139 --> 30:28,429
in this set,
30:28,429 --> 30:28,789
you can take
30:28,789 --> 30:29,49
products.
30:29,49 --> 30:30,39
There's a multiplicative
30:30,39 --> 30:30,489
identity
30:30,489 --> 30:30,839
on the set.
30:30,839 --> 30:31,229
Anything
30:31,229 --> 30:31,539
has an inverse.
30:31,539 --> 30:31,839
And finally,
30:31,839 --> 30:32,229
the product
30:32,229 --> 30:32,609
is associative.
30:32,609 --> 30:32,869
Because
30:32,869 --> 30:33,209
that was true
30:33,209 --> 30:33,519
of the product
30:33,519 --> 30:34,49
on the larger set
30:34,49 --> 30:34,419
of matrices.
30:34,419 --> 30:34,639
AB
30:34,639 --> 30:35,69
times C
30:35,69 --> 30:36,39
is A
30:36,39 --> 30:36,719
times
30:36,719 --> 30:37,239
BC.
30:37,239 --> 30:37,469
So,
30:37,469 --> 30:37,809
we have four
30:37,809 --> 30:38,129
properties
30:38,129 --> 30:38,539
of this
30:38,539 --> 30:38,979
subset
30:38,979 --> 30:39,379
of the set
30:39,379 --> 30:39,729
of matrices.
30:39,729 --> 30:39,889
It has
30:39,889 --> 30:40,279
a multiplication
30:40,279 --> 30:40,629
law. The multiplication
30:40,629 --> 30:40,989
law is associative.
30:40,989 --> 30:41,349
There's
30:41,349 --> 30:41,669
an identity
30:41,669 --> 30:42,49
element,
30:42,49 --> 30:42,399
and there's an inverse
30:42,399 --> 30:42,769
for every element.
30:42,769 --> 30:42,999
And
30:42,999 --> 30:43,319
those properties
30:43,319 --> 30:43,669
make up
30:43,669 --> 30:44,89
the properties
30:44,89 --> 30:45,149
of what we call
30:45,149 --> 30:45,639
a group.
30:45,639 --> 30:45,829
So
30:45,829 --> 30:46,199
this
30:46,199 --> 30:46,419
is the first
30:46,419 --> 30:47,259
and most important
30:47,259 --> 30:47,549
example
30:47,549 --> 30:47,929
of a group.
30:47,929 --> 30:48,159
So I'll now tell you
30:48,159 --> 30:48,479
what a group is.
30:48,479 --> 30:48,709
And that's why we need
30:48,709 --> 30:49,89
the linear algebra
30:49,89 --> 30:50,279
to generate
30:50,279 --> 30:50,569
for us
30:50,569 --> 30:50,839
immediately
30:50,839 --> 30:51,319
some good examples
30:51,319 --> 30:51,679
of groups.
30:51,679 --> 30:51,989
I'll give you some more
30:51,989 --> 30:52,269
examples,
30:52,269 --> 30:52,619
but that's our first
30:52,619 --> 30:52,939
example.
30:52,939 --> 30:53,189
So
30:53,189 --> 30:53,419
a group
30:53,419 --> 30:53,589
G
30:53,589 --> 30:53,849
is a set
30:53,849 --> 30:54,119
with
30:54,119 --> 30:54,479
a product
30:54,479 --> 30:54,839
operation.
30:54,839 --> 30:55,149
So
30:55,149 --> 30:55,419
if you have two elements
30:55,419 --> 30:55,779
in the set,
30:55,779 --> 30:56,159
you can take
30:56,159 --> 30:56,449
their product,
30:56,449 --> 30:56,779
not necessarily
30:56,779 --> 30:57,209
commutative.
30:57,209 --> 30:57,439
So g
30:57,439 --> 30:57,739
times
30:57,739 --> 30:58,69
h
30:58,69 --> 30:58,259
which is
30:58,259 --> 30:58,479
one
30:58,479 --> 30:58,849
associative,
30:58,849 --> 30:59,149
two
30:59,149 --> 30:59,509
has an identity
30:59,509 --> 30:59,929
element
30:59,929 --> 31:00,279
which is sometimes
31:00,279 --> 31:00,619
denoted
31:00,619 --> 31:00,829
E
31:00,829 --> 31:01,119
or sometimes
31:01,119 --> 31:01,429
denoted
31:01,429 --> 31:01,669
one,
31:01,669 --> 31:01,879
has
31:01,879 --> 31:02,159
inverses,
31:02,159 --> 31:02,549
namely every
31:02,549 --> 31:02,879
element
31:02,879 --> 31:03,279
in the group,
31:03,279 --> 31:03,619
there's
31:03,619 --> 31:03,849
another
31:03,849 --> 31:04,239
element
31:04,239 --> 31:04,589
called g
31:04,589 --> 31:04,849
inverse
31:04,849 --> 31:05,259
whose product
31:05,259 --> 31:05,629
with g
31:05,629 --> 31:06,29
is the identity
31:06,29 --> 31:06,509
element.
31:06,509 --> 31:06,739
That's it.
31:06,739 --> 31:07,19
Those are the properties
31:07,19 --> 31:07,409
of a group.
31:07,409 --> 31:07,639
A product,
31:07,639 --> 31:08,29
it has to be associative,
31:08,29 --> 31:08,459
there has to be
31:08,459 --> 31:08,789
an distinguished
31:08,789 --> 31:09,289
identity
31:09,289 --> 31:09,539
element
31:09,539 --> 31:09,779
there,
31:09,779 --> 31:10,229
and there have to be
31:10,229 --> 31:10,529
inverses
31:10,529 --> 31:10,899
for every element.
31:10,899 --> 31:11,249
It does
31:11,249 --> 31:11,449
not have to be
31:11,449 --> 31:11,829
commutative.
31:11,829 --> 31:11,979
If
31:11,979 --> 31:12,169
if
31:12,169 --> 31:12,409
GH
31:12,409 --> 31:12,779
is equal
31:12,779 --> 31:13,159
to HG
31:13,159 --> 31:13,459
for all
31:13,459 --> 31:13,819
pairs,
31:13,819 --> 31:14,189
you either
31:14,189 --> 31:14,559
say the group
31:14,559 --> 31:14,779
say
31:14,779 --> 31:14,979
G
31:14,979 --> 31:15,229
is commutative
31:15,229 --> 31:15,489
or sometimes
31:15,489 --> 31:15,859
abelian.
31:15,859 --> 31:16,79
Abelian
31:16,79 --> 31:16,479
comes
31:16,479 --> 31:16,769
from the great
31:16,769 --> 31:16,979
Norwegian
31:16,979 --> 31:17,349
mathematician
31:17,349 --> 31:17,679
Abel,
31:17,679 --> 31:18,79
who was one of
31:18,79 --> 31:18,379
the invent
31:18,379 --> 31:18,709
Niels Abel,
31:18,709 --> 31:19,219
early 19th century
31:19,219 --> 31:19,619
Norwegian
31:19,619 --> 31:19,999
mathematician,
31:19,999 --> 31:20,239
who uh
31:20,239 --> 31:20,539
was one of the
31:20,539 --> 31:20,939
originators
31:20,939 --> 31:21,369
of group theory.
31:21,369 --> 31:22,69
The great originator
31:22,69 --> 31:22,479
of group theory
31:22,479 --> 31:22,899
was the famous
31:22,899 --> 31:23,219
young
31:23,219 --> 31:23,629
French
31:23,629 --> 31:24,69
mathematician
31:24,69 --> 31:24,539
Evariste
31:24,539 --> 31:24,929
Galois.
31:24,929 --> 31:25,239
Both
31:25,239 --> 31:25,529
Abel
31:25,529 --> 31:25,849
and Galois
31:25,849 --> 31:26,259
lived in the early
31:26,259 --> 31:26,619
decades
31:26,619 --> 31:26,969
of the 19th century,
31:26,969 --> 31:27,319
both died
31:27,319 --> 31:27,649
in their 20s.
31:27,649 --> 31:28,119
Galois
31:28,119 --> 31:28,379
died
31:28,379 --> 31:28,699
as a result
31:28,699 --> 31:29,139
of a duel.
31:29,139 --> 31:29,359
Abel
31:29,359 --> 31:29,559
died
31:29,559 --> 31:29,849
basically
31:29,849 --> 31:30,209
because he was
31:30,209 --> 31:30,579
too poor
31:30,579 --> 31:30,899
and couldn't find
31:30,899 --> 31:31,249
employment
31:31,249 --> 31:31,549
for a Norwegian,
31:31,549 --> 31:31,819
it was very hard
31:31,819 --> 31:32,179
to find employment
31:32,179 --> 31:32,459
in mathematical
31:32,459 --> 31:32,839
Europe
31:32,839 --> 31:33,129
at the time.
31:33,129 --> 31:33,429
But together
31:33,429 --> 31:33,849
they really
31:33,849 --> 31:34,199
put together
31:34,199 --> 31:34,619
the foundations
31:34,619 --> 31:35,79
of group theory.
31:35,79 --> 31:36,459
Galois's
31:36,459 --> 31:36,779
work wasn't
31:36,779 --> 31:37,169
appreciated
31:37,169 --> 31:37,509
for about
31:37,509 --> 31:37,909
50 years.
31:37,909 --> 31:38,209
So he
31:38,209 --> 31:38,469
sent his work
31:38,469 --> 31:38,839
to the great
31:38,839 --> 31:39,189
mathematicians
31:39,189 --> 31:39,579
of the time,
31:39,579 --> 31:39,829
Gauss,
31:39,829 --> 31:40,89
Koshi,
31:40,89 --> 31:40,549
etc.,
31:40,549 --> 31:40,889
and they
31:40,889 --> 31:41,229
all put it
31:41,229 --> 31:41,469
aside.
31:41,469 --> 31:41,729
It was only
31:41,729 --> 31:41,979
at the end of
31:41,979 --> 31:42,349
the 19th century
31:42,349 --> 31:42,659
when French
31:42,659 --> 31:42,949
mathematician
31:42,949 --> 31:43,259
Jordan
31:43,259 --> 31:43,619
realized
31:43,619 --> 31:43,989
how fundamental
31:43,989 --> 31:44,379
Galois's
31:44,379 --> 31:44,719
discoveries
31:44,719 --> 31:44,989
were,
31:44,989 --> 31:45,279
many of which
31:45,279 --> 31:45,629
were written
31:45,629 --> 31:45,939
up in a letter
31:45,939 --> 31:46,329
he sent to a friend
31:46,329 --> 31:46,659
the night
31:46,659 --> 31:47,19
before he died
31:47,19 --> 31:47,469
in this duel.
31:47,469 --> 31:47,739
If any of
31:47,739 --> 31:47,969
you have been
31:47,969 --> 31:48,239
to Paris
31:48,239 --> 31:48,869
and take
31:48,869 --> 31:49,169
the Ligne de Sceaux,
31:49,169 --> 31:49,429
uh
31:49,429 --> 31:49,689
you pass
31:49,689 --> 31:50,259
through a beautiful
31:50,259 --> 31:50,639
or I shouldn't say
31:50,639 --> 31:50,979
beautiful,
31:50,979 --> 31:51,389
a disgusting
31:51,389 --> 31:51,869
Parisian
31:51,869 --> 31:52,199
suburb
31:52,199 --> 31:52,599
called
31:52,599 --> 31:52,839
Bourg-la-Reine
31:52,839 --> 31:53,149
where
31:53,149 --> 31:53,479
Galois's
31:53,479 --> 31:53,779
father
31:53,779 --> 31:54,79
was mayor
31:54,79 --> 31:54,449
and Galois
31:54,449 --> 31:54,739
born
31:54,739 --> 31:55,89
was born
31:55,89 --> 31:55,479
and lived
31:55,479 --> 31:55,819
much of his life.
31:55,819 --> 31:56,159
And
31:56,159 --> 31:56,459
there's a plaque
31:56,459 --> 31:56,769
in the most
31:56,769 --> 31:57,119
disgusting
31:57,119 --> 31:57,509
uh
31:57,509 --> 31:57,819
intersection
31:57,819 --> 31:58,219
in the middle of
31:58,219 --> 31:58,539
Bourg-la-Reine
31:58,539 --> 31:58,929
where the trucks
31:58,929 --> 31:59,299
are going
31:59,299 --> 31:59,539
by
31:59,539 --> 31:59,989
and it says,
31:59,989 --> 32:00,239
"Ici
32:00,239 --> 32:00,579
est né
32:00,579 --> 32:01,29
Evariste
32:01,29 --> 32:01,359
Galois,
32:01,359 --> 32:01,639
illustre
32:01,639 --> 32:01,969
mathématicien
32:01,969 --> 32:02,449
français."
32:02,449 --> 32:02,659
That's
32:02,659 --> 32:02,949
the way a country
32:02,949 --> 32:03,269
honors its heroes.
32:03,269 --> 32:03,529
Um,
32:03,959 --> 32:04,309
actually
32:04,309 --> 32:04,639
many streets
32:04,639 --> 32:04,969
in Paris
32:04,969 --> 32:05,289
are named
32:05,289 --> 32:05,639
after mathematicians.
32:05,639 --> 32:05,919
If any of
32:05,919 --> 32:06,209
you have been
32:06,209 --> 32:06,559
on the rue
32:06,559 --> 32:06,829
Monge,
32:06,829 --> 32:07,179
Monge
32:07,179 --> 32:07,499
was a great
32:07,499 --> 32:07,839
mathematician
32:07,839 --> 32:08,229
who accompanied
32:08,229 --> 32:08,629
Napoleon
32:08,629 --> 32:08,969
to Egypt
32:08,969 --> 32:09,329
to do surveying
32:09,329 --> 32:09,869
and Egyptology.
32:09,869 --> 32:10,229
But
32:10,229 --> 32:10,499
um,
32:10,499 --> 32:10,809
Galois
32:10,809 --> 32:11,79
is undoubtedly
32:11,79 --> 32:11,479
the most famous
32:11,479 --> 32:11,899
young
32:11,899 --> 32:12,239
mathematician
32:12,239 --> 32:12,639
to die young.
32:12,639 --> 32:12,839
But
32:12,839 --> 32:13,129
in his
32:13,129 --> 32:13,459
head,
32:13,459 --> 32:13,779
he discovered
32:13,779 --> 32:14,149
not only
32:14,149 --> 32:14,589
the theory
32:14,589 --> 32:14,919
of finite fields,
32:14,919 --> 32:15,319
which
32:15,319 --> 32:15,559
we'll cover
32:15,559 --> 32:15,859
later on,
32:15,859 --> 32:16,289
and wrote
32:16,289 --> 32:16,629
the treatment
32:16,629 --> 32:16,969
of finite fields,
32:16,969 --> 32:17,289
it's the best
32:17,289 --> 32:17,609
treatment
32:17,609 --> 32:17,939
in the literature
32:17,939 --> 32:18,229
today,
32:18,229 --> 32:18,459
but
32:18,459 --> 32:18,729
also
32:18,729 --> 32:19,99
discovered
32:19,99 --> 32:19,459
almost
32:19,459 --> 32:19,799
all the foundations
32:19,799 --> 32:20,199
of group theory.
32:20,199 --> 32:20,489
And
32:20,489 --> 32:20,729
it was Galois
32:20,729 --> 32:21,149
who realized
32:21,149 --> 32:21,509
there could be
32:21,509 --> 32:21,859
very interesting
32:21,859 --> 32:22,279
groups
32:22,279 --> 32:22,679
where GH
32:22,679 --> 32:23,49
was not equal
32:23,49 --> 32:23,469
to HG.
32:23,469 --> 32:23,609
Yeah.
32:23,609 --> 32:23,789
Is
32:23,789 --> 32:23,979
it required
32:23,979 --> 32:24,289
that the product
32:24,289 --> 32:24,609
operation
32:24,609 --> 32:24,849
is closed,
32:24,849 --> 32:25,99
is that assumed?
32:25,99 --> 32:25,289
Yeah,
32:25,289 --> 32:25,519
when I say
32:25,519 --> 32:25,799
a product
32:25,799 --> 32:26,99
operation,
32:26,99 --> 32:26,419
it means
32:26,419 --> 32:26,919
that for any two
32:26,919 --> 32:27,209
elements
32:27,209 --> 32:27,529
in the set
32:27,529 --> 32:27,829
G,
32:27,829 --> 32:28,89
there's
32:28,89 --> 32:28,409
a product
32:28,409 --> 32:28,759
GH
32:28,759 --> 32:29,29
which is in
32:29,29 --> 32:29,449
G.
32:29,449 --> 32:29,649
So,
32:29,649 --> 32:30,89
associated
32:30,89 --> 32:30,459
to any two
32:30,459 --> 32:30,759
elements,
32:30,759 --> 32:31,39
you get a third.
32:31,39 --> 32:31,309
I'm going to get
32:31,309 --> 32:31,569
Now this
32:31,569 --> 32:32,9
this is a very interesting
32:32,9 --> 32:32,489
group,
32:32,489 --> 32:32,659
the
32:32,659 --> 32:32,959
the group of
32:32,959 --> 32:33,269
invertible
32:33,269 --> 32:33,589
matrices,
32:33,589 --> 32:34,309
in that
32:34,309 --> 32:34,629
already
32:34,629 --> 32:34,849
when we get
32:34,849 --> 32:35,169
to 2 by 2
32:35,169 --> 32:35,469
matrices,
32:35,469 --> 32:35,849
we have a lot
32:35,849 --> 32:36,249
of non-commutative
32:36,249 --> 32:36,709
groups.
32:36,709 --> 32:36,899
Right?
32:36,899 --> 32:37,249
You can find
32:37,249 --> 32:37,529
two invertible
32:37,529 --> 32:37,889
matrices.
32:37,889 --> 32:38,159
The ones
32:38,159 --> 32:38,399
I wrote down
32:38,399 --> 32:38,679
by the way
32:38,679 --> 32:38,899
weren't invertible.
32:38,899 --> 32:39,149
So
32:39,149 --> 32:39,409
that'll be
32:39,409 --> 32:39,669
a challenge
32:39,669 --> 32:40,99
for you
32:40,99 --> 32:40,449
to find
32:40,449 --> 32:40,879
invertible
32:40,879 --> 32:41,289
matrices
32:41,289 --> 32:41,649
such that
32:41,649 --> 32:41,989
AB
32:41,989 --> 32:42,259
is not equal
32:42,259 --> 32:42,619
to BA.
32:42,619 --> 32:42,819
Good
32:42,819 --> 32:43,129
homework problem
32:43,129 --> 32:43,439
there,
32:43,439 --> 32:43,629
Peter.
32:43,629 --> 32:43,789
It's
32:43,789 --> 32:43,959
already there?
32:43,959 --> 32:44,219
The home
32:44,219 --> 32:44,409
it's
32:44,409 --> 32:44,809
he's ahead of me.
32:44,809 --> 32:45,79
Damn
32:45,79 --> 32:45,339
kids.
32:45,339 --> 32:45,599
Um,
32:45,599 --> 32:45,879
anyhow,
32:45,879 --> 32:46,139
uh
32:46,139 --> 32:46,399
so,
32:46,399 --> 32:46,629
uh,
32:46,629 --> 32:46,899
but good
32:46,899 --> 32:47,159
question.
32:47,159 --> 32:47,399
Yeah,
32:47,399 --> 32:47,609
that
32:47,609 --> 32:47,839
you must
32:47,839 --> 32:48,9
have you
32:48,9 --> 32:48,469
you have to stay
32:48,469 --> 32:48,789
in your set.
32:48,789 --> 32:49,79
For any two
32:49,79 --> 32:49,399
elements
32:49,399 --> 32:49,689
in the set,
32:49,689 --> 32:49,969
sorry,
32:49,969 --> 32:50,209
the
32:50,209 --> 32:50,449
product
32:50,449 --> 32:50,769
is defined
32:50,769 --> 32:51,89
and in the set,
32:51,89 --> 32:51,429
it's
32:51,429 --> 32:51,689
associative,
32:51,689 --> 32:52,119
G
32:52,119 --> 32:52,439
H
32:52,439 --> 32:52,679
K
32:52,679 --> 32:53,149
is the same
32:53,149 --> 32:53,469
as G
32:53,469 --> 32:53,829
H
32:53,829 --> 32:54,279
times K.
32:54,279 --> 32:54,589
There's
32:54,589 --> 32:54,889
an identity
32:54,889 --> 32:55,259
element
32:55,259 --> 32:55,539
E
32:55,539 --> 32:55,819
such that
32:55,819 --> 32:56,159
E
32:56,159 --> 32:56,399
G
32:56,399 --> 32:56,729
is equal
32:56,729 --> 32:57,9
to G
32:57,9 --> 32:57,459
E
32:57,459 --> 32:57,779
is equal
32:57,779 --> 32:58,209
to G
32:58,209 --> 32:58,449
for every
32:58,449 --> 32:58,759
element
32:58,759 --> 32:59,109
in the set.
32:59,109 --> 32:59,369
I
32:59,369 --> 32:59,589
let me give you
32:59,589 --> 32:59,859
a simpler
32:59,859 --> 33:00,189
example
33:00,189 --> 33:00,499
of a group
33:00,499 --> 33:01,69
because
33:01,69 --> 33:01,389
this seems
33:01,389 --> 33:01,719
awfully
33:01,719 --> 33:01,979
complicated
33:01,979 --> 33:02,239
uh
33:02,239 --> 33:02,529
to go through
33:02,529 --> 33:02,909
to get a group.
33:02,909 --> 33:03,169
So
33:03,169 --> 33:03,339
you've been doing
33:03,339 --> 33:03,619
groups
33:03,619 --> 33:03,889
all your lives.
33:03,889 --> 33:04,129
Um
33:04,129 --> 33:04,389
it's like
33:04,389 --> 33:04,629
speaking
33:04,629 --> 33:04,879
prose.
33:04,879 --> 33:05,149
So
33:05,149 --> 33:05,339
here's an example
33:05,339 --> 33:05,709
of a group.
33:05,709 --> 33:05,899
An abelian
33:05,899 --> 33:06,219
group.
33:06,219 --> 33:06,469
Why don't we do
33:06,469 --> 33:06,799
an abelian group?
33:06,799 --> 33:06,999
The
33:06,999 --> 33:07,259
simplest
33:07,259 --> 33:07,629
abelian
33:07,629 --> 33:07,939
group is
33:07,939 --> 33:08,219
the integers.
33:08,219 --> 33:08,439
So
33:08,439 --> 33:08,709
that's the
33:08,709 --> 33:08,969
you know,
33:08,969 --> 33:09,229
0
33:09,229 --> 33:09,579
plus or minus
33:09,579 --> 33:09,849
1,
33:09,849 --> 33:10,169
plus or minus
33:10,169 --> 33:10,419
2,
33:10,419 --> 33:10,799
plus or minus
33:10,799 --> 33:11,179
3,
33:11,179 --> 33:11,469
positive
33:11,469 --> 33:11,819
and negative
33:11,819 --> 33:12,109
integers
33:12,109 --> 33:12,389
denoted
33:12,389 --> 33:12,699
by a bold
33:12,699 --> 33:13,99
face Z
33:13,99 --> 33:13,459
here.
33:13,459 --> 33:13,669
So,
33:13,669 --> 33:13,889
uh
33:13,889 --> 33:14,109
the
33:14,109 --> 33:14,339
the
33:14,339 --> 33:14,549
the
33:14,549 --> 33:14,729
uh product
33:14,729 --> 33:15,29
operation
33:15,29 --> 33:15,379
in the integers
33:15,379 --> 33:15,689
is addition.
33:15,689 --> 33:15,899
You know,
33:15,899 --> 33:16,129
A + B.
33:16,129 --> 33:16,349
That's
33:16,349 --> 33:16,639
the product
33:16,639 --> 33:16,929
operation.
33:16,929 --> 33:17,239
Uh
33:17,239 --> 33:17,509
that's
33:17,509 --> 33:17,789
clearly
33:17,789 --> 33:18,129
associative.
33:18,129 --> 33:18,499
When you add
33:18,499 --> 33:18,839
three things,
33:18,839 --> 33:19,169
it doesn't make
33:19,169 --> 33:19,429
any difference
33:19,429 --> 33:19,729
which order
33:19,729 --> 33:20,79
you do the adding.
33:20,79 --> 33:20,339
What's
33:20,339 --> 33:20,619
the identity
33:20,619 --> 33:20,939
element
33:20,939 --> 33:21,239
for addition
33:21,239 --> 33:21,539
in the group
33:21,539 --> 33:21,759
Z?
33:21,759 --> 33:21,959
This
33:21,959 --> 33:22,219
kind of stupid.
33:22,219 --> 33:22,399
Zero.
33:22,399 --> 33:22,689
Exactly.
33:22,689 --> 33:22,889
The
33:22,889 --> 33:23,209
identity
33:23,209 --> 33:23,529
element
33:23,529 --> 33:23,919
is zero.
33:23,919 --> 33:24,209
If you add
33:24,209 --> 33:24,529
0 to A,
33:24,529 --> 33:24,889
you always
33:24,889 --> 33:25,149
get A.
33:25,149 --> 33:25,429
What's
33:25,429 --> 33:25,709
the inverse
33:25,709 --> 33:25,999
element?
33:25,999 --> 33:26,319
What is A
33:26,319 --> 33:26,589
inverse?
33:26,589 --> 33:26,769
minus
33:26,769 --> 33:27,9
A. So if you take
33:27,9 --> 33:27,379
the negative
33:27,379 --> 33:27,649
number, that's
33:27,649 --> 33:27,959
how that's
33:27,959 --> 33:28,269
why we have negative
33:28,269 --> 33:28,619
numbers
33:28,619 --> 33:28,949
really, to turn
33:28,949 --> 33:29,279
counting
33:29,279 --> 33:29,569
numbers
33:29,569 --> 33:29,879
into a group.
33:29,879 --> 33:30,89
If you think
33:30,89 --> 33:30,339
of it.
33:30,339 --> 33:30,529
Well,
33:30,529 --> 33:30,739
what is
33:30,739 --> 33:30,959
-3?
33:30,959 --> 33:31,189
It's the
33:31,189 --> 33:31,409
thing you
33:31,409 --> 33:31,629
add to three
33:31,629 --> 33:31,999
to get zero.
33:31,999 --> 33:32,249
Okay?
33:32,249 --> 33:32,499
And
33:32,499 --> 33:32,729
um
33:32,729 --> 33:32,979
well,
33:32,979 --> 33:33,169
that does
33:33,169 --> 33:33,409
it.
33:33,409 --> 33:33,609
So
33:33,609 --> 33:33,869
this is a very
33:33,869 --> 33:34,209
simple
33:34,209 --> 33:34,449
group
33:34,449 --> 33:34,869
which has the
33:34,869 --> 33:35,179
property
33:35,179 --> 33:35,539
that A + B
33:35,539 --> 33:35,929
is B + A.
33:35,929 --> 33:36,219
So groups
33:36,219 --> 33:36,539
like this,
33:36,539 --> 33:36,819
of course,
33:36,819 --> 33:37,99
were studied
33:37,99 --> 33:37,449
before there
33:37,449 --> 33:37,689
was a notion
33:37,689 --> 33:37,999
of a group.
33:37,999 --> 33:38,229
I
33:38,229 --> 33:38,459
I'll tell you
33:38,459 --> 33:38,719
a funny story.
33:38,719 --> 33:39,9
So
33:39,9 --> 33:39,439
a a great
33:39,439 --> 33:39,769
um
33:39,769 --> 33:40,79
great German
33:40,79 --> 33:40,449
mathematician
33:40,449 --> 33:40,839
who I've
33:40,839 --> 33:41,149
collaborated
33:41,149 --> 33:41,539
with many
33:41,539 --> 33:41,789
times
33:41,789 --> 33:42,29
and
33:42,29 --> 33:42,419
is an altogether
33:42,419 --> 33:42,779
um
33:42,779 --> 33:43,59
is
33:43,59 --> 33:43,399
is a rare
33:43,399 --> 33:43,819
example
33:43,819 --> 33:44,89
of a prodigy
33:44,89 --> 33:44,489
who actually
33:44,489 --> 33:44,869
worked
33:44,869 --> 33:45,79
out,
33:45,79 --> 33:45,349
uh
33:45,349 --> 33:45,609
his name is
33:45,609 --> 33:45,879
Don
33:45,879 --> 33:46,139
Zagier.
33:46,139 --> 33:46,369
Uh
33:46,369 --> 33:46,619
he's the director
33:46,619 --> 33:46,959
of the Max
33:46,959 --> 33:47,299
Planck Institute
33:47,299 --> 33:47,559
uh for
33:47,559 --> 33:47,929
mathematical
33:47,929 --> 33:48,199
research
33:48,199 --> 33:48,409
in in
33:48,409 --> 33:48,829
Bonn. And
33:48,829 --> 33:49,199
um
33:49,639 --> 33:50,39
Don
33:50,449 --> 33:50,799
went to
33:50,799 --> 33:51,139
uh
33:51,579 --> 33:51,879
schools
33:51,879 --> 33:52,229
in about
33:52,229 --> 33:52,559
seven
33:52,559 --> 33:52,839
different
33:52,839 --> 33:53,169
countries
33:53,169 --> 33:53,569
when he was
33:53,569 --> 33:53,839
young.
33:53,839 --> 33:54,159
By the age
33:54,159 --> 33:54,479
of 13,
33:54,479 --> 33:54,939
he was speaking
33:54,939 --> 33:55,319
nine
33:55,319 --> 33:55,669
different
33:55,669 --> 33:55,969
languages
33:55,969 --> 33:56,319
and
33:56,319 --> 33:56,669
applied
33:56,669 --> 33:56,979
to get
33:56,979 --> 33:57,309
his
33:57,309 --> 33:57,589
uh
33:57,589 --> 33:57,939
undergraduate
33:57,939 --> 33:58,319
degree
33:58,319 --> 33:58,619
at Oxford.
33:58,619 --> 33:58,929
And
33:58,929 --> 33:59,179
he had taken
33:59,179 --> 33:59,499
the A-levels
33:59,499 --> 33:59,849
and O-levels
33:59,849 --> 34:00,129
even though
34:00,129 --> 34:00,449
he'd never
34:00,449 --> 34:00,699
been to England,
34:00,699 --> 34:00,979
and
34:00,979 --> 34:01,259
uh
34:01,259 --> 34:01,519
he was denied
34:01,519 --> 34:01,959
admission
34:01,959 --> 34:02,359
on the grounds
34:02,359 --> 34:02,749
that no one
34:02,749 --> 34:03,89
could attend
34:03,89 --> 34:03,449
Oxford
34:03,449 --> 34:03,829
before the
34:03,829 --> 34:04,209
age of 16.
34:04,209 --> 34:04,499
So,
34:04,499 --> 34:04,809
he got into
34:04,809 --> 34:05,149
MIT
34:05,149 --> 34:05,609
and finished
34:05,609 --> 34:05,959
MIT
34:05,959 --> 34:06,259
in two years,
34:06,259 --> 34:06,589
and then applied
34:06,589 --> 34:06,959
to Oxford
34:06,959 --> 34:07,339
as a graduate
34:07,339 --> 34:07,719
student
34:07,719 --> 34:08,59
at 15,
34:08,59 --> 34:08,459
and there was no
34:08,459 --> 34:08,829
objection
34:08,829 --> 34:09,209
at that point
34:09,209 --> 34:09,499
because
34:09,499 --> 34:09,789
that was as
34:09,789 --> 34:10,79
a graduate student.
34:10,79 --> 34:10,419
So
34:10,419 --> 34:10,629
Don
34:10,629 --> 34:10,819
said
34:10,819 --> 34:11,109
when he recalled
34:11,109 --> 34:11,489
his algebra
34:11,489 --> 34:11,809
course
34:11,809 --> 34:12,119
from MIT,
34:12,119 --> 34:12,419
he
34:12,419 --> 34:12,649
was so
34:12,649 --> 34:12,919
confused
34:12,919 --> 34:13,289
the whole time
34:13,289 --> 34:13,649
he took the course,
34:13,649 --> 34:13,979
but he learned
34:13,979 --> 34:14,349
how to do it
34:14,349 --> 34:14,619
because
34:14,619 --> 34:14,879
he's a very
34:14,879 --> 34:15,129
good mathematician.
34:15,129 --> 34:15,419
He
34:15,419 --> 34:15,659
said that
34:15,659 --> 34:16,29
his idea
34:16,29 --> 34:16,409
of a group
34:16,409 --> 34:16,939
as he got out
34:16,939 --> 34:17,229
of this course
34:17,229 --> 34:17,649
was that a group
34:17,649 --> 34:17,999
was the integers.
34:17,999 --> 34:18,329
All
34:18,329 --> 34:18,569
groups
34:18,569 --> 34:18,929
were the integers.
34:18,929 --> 34:19,209
Except
34:19,209 --> 34:19,629
that somehow
34:19,629 --> 34:19,939
when you were doing
34:19,939 --> 34:20,289
the problems,
34:20,289 --> 34:20,629
you weren't
34:20,629 --> 34:20,899
allowed
34:20,899 --> 34:21,229
to use the
34:21,229 --> 34:21,499
fact that
34:21,499 --> 34:21,819
A + B
34:21,819 --> 34:22,189
was B + A.
34:22,189 --> 34:22,449
And he
34:22,449 --> 34:22,659
thought
34:22,659 --> 34:22,949
that this was
34:22,949 --> 34:23,249
very strange,
34:23,249 --> 34:23,509
and
34:23,509 --> 34:23,819
it was a strange
34:23,819 --> 34:24,209
way to teach,
34:24,209 --> 34:24,529
but if
34:24,529 --> 34:24,779
those were the
34:24,779 --> 34:25,99
rules of higher
34:25,99 --> 34:25,449
mathematics,
34:25,449 --> 34:25,839
he would go
34:25,839 --> 34:26,59
with it.
34:26,59 --> 34:26,329
So,
34:26,329 --> 34:26,619
I want to point
34:26,619 --> 34:26,889
out that sometimes
34:26,889 --> 34:27,259
you are allowed
34:27,259 --> 34:27,589
to use the rules
34:27,589 --> 34:27,979
that A + B
34:27,979 --> 34:28,299
is B + A
34:28,299 --> 34:28,599
when it holds.
34:28,599 --> 34:28,859
Another
34:28,859 --> 34:29,179
example
34:29,179 --> 34:29,659
of a group is
34:29,659 --> 34:29,929
any vector
34:29,929 --> 34:30,319
space.
34:30,319 --> 34:30,509
That's
34:30,509 --> 34:30,779
a group because
34:30,779 --> 34:31,69
you just forget
34:31,69 --> 34:31,429
about the scalar
34:31,429 --> 34:31,789
multiplication.
34:31,789 --> 34:32,149
The addition,
34:32,149 --> 34:32,429
the
34:32,429 --> 34:32,679
the binary
34:32,679 --> 34:33,19
operation
34:33,19 --> 34:33,419
is addition
34:33,419 --> 34:33,799
of vectors.
34:33,799 --> 34:34,89
The
34:34,89 --> 34:34,409
identity
34:34,409 --> 34:34,739
element
34:34,739 --> 34:35,109
is the zero
34:35,109 --> 34:35,479
vector.
34:35,479 --> 34:35,719
Right?
34:35,719 --> 34:35,999
You add the
34:35,999 --> 34:36,249
zero vector
34:36,249 --> 34:36,549
and any vector,
34:36,549 --> 34:36,879
you get the vector
34:36,879 --> 34:37,149
back.
34:37,149 --> 34:37,339
The
34:37,339 --> 34:37,579
the
34:37,579 --> 34:37,799
the
34:37,799 --> 34:37,979
the inverse
34:37,979 --> 34:38,319
element
34:38,319 --> 34:38,649
is the negative
34:38,649 --> 34:38,999
vector.
34:38,999 --> 34:39,249
Okay,
34:39,249 --> 34:39,499
so
34:39,499 --> 34:39,829
you just
34:39,829 --> 34:40,129
you just forget
34:40,129 --> 34:40,489
scalar
34:40,489 --> 34:40,789
multiplication.
34:40,789 --> 34:40,999
So
34:40,999 --> 34:41,319
it turns
34:41,319 --> 34:41,579
out that once
34:41,579 --> 34:41,869
you come up
34:41,869 --> 34:42,209
with this rather
34:42,209 --> 34:42,559
simple definition,
34:42,559 --> 34:42,919
there are groups
34:42,919 --> 34:43,229
all over
34:43,229 --> 34:43,459
the place.
34:43,459 --> 34:43,709
This is
34:43,709 --> 34:43,969
also an abelian
34:43,969 --> 34:44,349
group.
34:44,349 --> 34:44,519
In
34:44,519 --> 34:44,729
some sense,
34:44,729 --> 34:45,99
the most
34:45,99 --> 34:45,439
general
34:45,439 --> 34:45,749
group you
34:45,749 --> 34:46,9
get is
34:46,9 --> 34:46,329
as follows.
34:46,329 --> 34:46,529
Uh
34:46,529 --> 34:46,739
and
34:46,739 --> 34:46,949
this will be
34:46,949 --> 34:47,219
the last thing
34:47,219 --> 34:47,529
I'll talk about
34:47,529 --> 34:47,869
and then I'll
34:47,869 --> 34:48,129
let you get out
34:48,129 --> 34:48,399
of here.
34:48,399 --> 34:48,599
Uh
34:48,599 --> 34:48,779
if you
34:48,779 --> 34:49,29
start
34:49,29 --> 34:49,369
with any set,
34:49,369 --> 34:49,629
call
34:49,629 --> 34:49,869
it the set
34:49,869 --> 34:50,139
T.
34:50,139 --> 34:50,289
And
34:50,289 --> 34:50,569
you let
34:50,569 --> 34:50,789
G
34:50,789 --> 34:51,219
be the set
34:51,219 --> 34:51,519
of all
34:51,519 --> 34:51,919
bijections
34:51,919 --> 34:52,229
G
34:52,229 --> 34:52,609
from T
34:52,609 --> 34:52,959
to itself.
34:52,959 --> 34:53,199
So
34:53,199 --> 34:53,519
that means
34:53,519 --> 34:53,859
one to one
34:53,859 --> 34:54,209
and onto
34:54,209 --> 34:54,569
maps
34:54,569 --> 34:54,879
from a set
34:54,879 --> 34:55,229
to itself.
34:55,229 --> 34:55,519
All
34:55,519 --> 34:55,929
bijections.
34:55,929 --> 34:56,199
Then
34:56,199 --> 34:56,529
that's a group,
34:56,529 --> 34:56,799
it's sometimes
34:56,799 --> 34:57,249
I'll denote
34:57,249 --> 34:57,569
it by the symmetries
34:57,569 --> 34:58,49
of T.
34:58,49 --> 34:58,329
Or
34:58,329 --> 34:58,559
the symmetric
34:58,559 --> 34:59,79
group of the set
34:59,79 --> 34:59,519
T.
34:59,519 --> 34:59,699
is a group.
34:59,699 --> 35:00,109
Someone's
35:00,109 --> 35:00,409
got a phone call.
35:00,409 --> 35:00,649
I
35:00,649 --> 35:00,889
hope it's not me.
35:00,889 --> 35:01,209
Mine plays
35:01,209 --> 35:01,609
La Traviata.
35:01,609 --> 35:01,869
So
35:01,869 --> 35:02,129
occasionally
35:02,129 --> 35:02,479
there'll be an emergency,
35:02,479 --> 35:02,809
someone's
35:02,809 --> 35:03,89
about to jump
35:03,89 --> 35:03,429
off a bridge
35:03,429 --> 35:03,769
or something
35:03,769 --> 35:03,999
that requires
35:03,999 --> 35:04,299
the attention
35:04,299 --> 35:04,549
of the Dean.
35:04,549 --> 35:04,779
So
35:04,779 --> 35:05,79
you'll hear
35:05,79 --> 35:05,289
I figure
35:05,289 --> 35:05,539
I
35:05,539 --> 35:05,829
I wanted
35:05,829 --> 35:06,149
a cheerful
35:06,149 --> 35:06,469
tune.
35:06,469 --> 35:06,699
So
35:06,699 --> 35:06,949
to deal with it.
35:06,949 --> 35:07,179
So this is
35:07,179 --> 35:07,449
a group
35:07,449 --> 35:07,799
under composition.
35:07,799 --> 35:08,99
Composition
35:08,99 --> 35:08,869
of
35:08,869 --> 35:09,259
bijections.
35:09,259 --> 35:09,549
If you
35:09,549 --> 35:09,829
compose
35:09,829 --> 35:10,119
one bijection
35:10,119 --> 35:10,479
with another,
35:10,479 --> 35:10,849
you get a third
35:10,849 --> 35:11,229
because if two
35:11,229 --> 35:11,479
maps are one
35:11,479 --> 35:11,759
to one and you compose
35:11,759 --> 35:12,139
them, you get
35:12,139 --> 35:12,409
a third one
35:12,409 --> 35:12,709
to one map.
35:12,709 --> 35:12,979
If two maps
35:12,979 --> 35:13,279
are onto
35:13,279 --> 35:13,539
and you compose
35:13,539 --> 35:13,859
them you get another
35:13,859 --> 35:14,129
onto
35:14,129 --> 35:14,419
map.
35:14,419 --> 35:14,619
So that's
35:14,619 --> 35:14,899
the
35:14,899 --> 35:15,259
the composition
35:15,259 --> 35:15,609
law
35:15,609 --> 35:16,89
of transformations.
35:16,89 --> 35:16,289
The
35:16,289 --> 35:16,589
identity
35:16,589 --> 35:16,899
element
35:16,899 --> 35:17,309
is the
35:17,309 --> 35:17,549
identity
35:17,549 --> 35:17,909
transformation
35:17,909 --> 35:18,229
that takes
35:18,229 --> 35:18,539
every element
35:18,539 --> 35:18,879
in the set
35:18,879 --> 35:19,219
T to itself.
35:19,219 --> 35:19,519
That's
35:19,519 --> 35:19,799
certainly
35:19,799 --> 35:20,129
one to one and
35:20,129 --> 35:20,369
onto.
35:20,369 --> 35:20,629
The
35:20,629 --> 35:20,889
inverse element
35:20,889 --> 35:21,269
is the inverse
35:21,269 --> 35:21,629
transformation.
35:21,629 --> 35:21,899
If you have a
35:21,899 --> 35:22,209
transformation
35:22,209 --> 35:22,569
that's one to one and
35:22,569 --> 35:22,799
onto,
35:22,799 --> 35:23,169
you can send
35:23,169 --> 35:23,469
the transformation
35:23,469 --> 35:23,809
back.
35:23,809 --> 35:24,79
That's G
35:24,79 --> 35:24,419
inverse.
35:24,419 --> 35:24,619
And
35:24,619 --> 35:24,879
composition
35:24,879 --> 35:25,249
of maps
35:25,249 --> 35:25,599
is associative,
35:25,599 --> 35:25,959
just like
35:25,959 --> 35:26,239
we prove
35:26,239 --> 35:26,529
composition
35:26,529 --> 35:26,959
of linear
35:26,959 --> 35:27,259
maps
35:27,259 --> 35:27,579
is associative.
35:27,579 --> 35:27,829
Because
35:27,829 --> 35:28,89
if you have three
35:28,89 --> 35:28,439
maps,
35:28,439 --> 35:28,709
then
35:28,709 --> 35:29,19
and you compose
35:29,19 --> 35:29,399
them, no matter
35:29,399 --> 35:29,629
how which
35:29,629 --> 35:29,959
way you do it,
35:29,959 --> 35:30,289
then it's
35:30,289 --> 35:30,569
the final
35:30,569 --> 35:30,849
map that
35:30,849 --> 35:31,149
takes
35:31,149 --> 35:31,439
an element
35:31,439 --> 35:31,719
in T
35:31,719 --> 35:31,989
first to this
35:31,989 --> 35:32,259
map, then
35:32,259 --> 35:32,549
to that map,
35:32,549 --> 35:32,839
then to a third
35:32,839 --> 35:33,169
thing in T.
35:33,169 --> 35:33,369
So
35:33,369 --> 35:33,609
this is
35:33,609 --> 35:33,899
the most
35:33,899 --> 35:34,209
general
35:34,209 --> 35:34,449
group in
35:34,449 --> 35:34,739
some sense
35:34,739 --> 35:35,79
of the word.
35:35,79 --> 35:35,319
One second,
35:35,319 --> 35:35,609
I just want to
35:35,609 --> 35:35,849
finish.
35:35,849 --> 35:36,149
And
35:36,149 --> 35:36,409
all groups,
35:36,409 --> 35:36,769
all groups,
35:36,769 --> 35:37,69
we'll
35:37,69 --> 35:37,439
see somehow
35:37,439 --> 35:37,809
arise
35:37,809 --> 35:38,249
by putting
35:38,249 --> 35:38,569
extra
35:38,569 --> 35:38,859
conditions
35:38,859 --> 35:39,299
on this
35:39,299 --> 35:39,589
invertible
35:39,589 --> 35:40,79
bijection.
35:40,79 --> 35:40,419
So for
35:40,419 --> 35:40,699
example,
35:40,699 --> 35:41,79
this group
35:41,79 --> 35:41,459
GLNR,
35:41,459 --> 35:41,709
how did
35:41,709 --> 35:41,979
that come about?
35:41,979 --> 35:42,279
Well,
35:42,279 --> 35:42,549
I started
35:42,549 --> 35:42,839
out with a
35:42,839 --> 35:43,139
set
35:43,139 --> 35:43,369
which was
35:43,369 --> 35:43,709
Rn,
35:43,709 --> 35:43,879
the
35:43,879 --> 35:44,149
set which
35:44,149 --> 35:44,409
was Rn.
35:44,409 --> 35:44,669
And
35:44,669 --> 35:44,889
I considered
35:44,889 --> 35:45,329
all invertible
35:45,329 --> 35:45,689
maps
35:45,689 --> 35:45,979
from Rn
35:45,979 --> 35:46,289
to Rn
35:46,289 --> 35:46,619
which
35:46,619 --> 35:46,939
preserve
35:46,939 --> 35:47,269
the linearity.
35:47,269 --> 35:47,509
Which
35:47,509 --> 35:47,829
preserve
35:47,829 --> 35:48,259
the structure
35:48,259 --> 35:48,609
of a vector
35:48,609 --> 35:48,939
space. That's
35:48,939 --> 35:49,199
not all
35:49,199 --> 35:49,459
maps, but
35:49,459 --> 35:49,729
the ones that
35:49,729 --> 35:49,999
preserve
35:49,999 --> 35:50,339
some structure.
35:50,339 --> 35:50,639
And
35:50,639 --> 35:50,979
that's how I got
35:50,979 --> 35:51,269
invertible
35:51,269 --> 35:51,639
matrices.
35:51,639 --> 35:51,929
So
35:51,929 --> 35:52,199
we're going to
35:52,199 --> 35:52,419
see that
35:52,419 --> 35:52,649
this is
35:52,649 --> 35:52,889
somehow,
35:52,889 --> 35:53,169
and this was
35:53,169 --> 35:53,449
Galois's
35:53,449 --> 35:53,799
big idea
35:53,799 --> 35:54,149
that when
35:54,149 --> 35:54,389
you study
35:54,389 --> 35:54,689
maps or
35:54,689 --> 35:54,979
symmetries
35:54,979 --> 35:55,349
of a set,
35:55,349 --> 35:55,719
that was
35:55,719 --> 35:55,959
one group
35:55,959 --> 35:56,259
and then you could
35:56,259 --> 35:56,509
get very interesting
35:56,509 --> 35:56,919
groups by
35:56,919 --> 35:57,299
studying
35:57,299 --> 35:57,579
symmetries
35:57,579 --> 35:57,959
that preserve
35:57,959 --> 35:58,309
some extra
35:58,309 --> 35:58,649
structure
35:58,649 --> 35:58,959
in the set,
35:58,959 --> 35:59,289
like some
35:59,289 --> 35:59,559
linear
35:59,559 --> 35:59,889
structure
35:59,889 --> 36:00,239
on the set.
36:00,239 --> 36:00,429
And
36:00,429 --> 36:00,669
in particular,
36:00,669 --> 36:01,109
we're going to have
36:01,109 --> 36:01,359
one very
36:01,359 --> 36:01,649
famous
36:01,649 --> 36:01,939
group
36:01,939 --> 36:02,269
where this
36:02,269 --> 36:02,499
T
36:02,499 --> 36:02,769
is the set
36:02,769 --> 36:03,159
of
36:03,159 --> 36:03,319
an
36:03,319 --> 36:03,539
a finite
36:03,539 --> 36:03,819
set
36:03,819 --> 36:04,109
and all finite
36:04,109 --> 36:04,469
sets
36:04,469 --> 36:04,949
are determined
36:04,949 --> 36:05,269
by the number
36:05,269 --> 36:05,579
of elements
36:05,579 --> 36:05,879
in them.
36:05,879 --> 36:06,79
So the set
36:06,79 --> 36:06,449
from 1
36:06,449 --> 36:06,709
to n,
36:06,709 --> 36:07,79
then
36:07,79 --> 36:07,319
we'll call the
36:07,319 --> 36:07,589
symmetry
36:07,589 --> 36:07,949
group of T,
36:07,949 --> 36:08,239
the
36:08,239 --> 36:08,519
symmetric
36:08,519 --> 36:08,879
group S
36:08,879 --> 36:09,149
sub n.
36:09,149 --> 36:09,379
We'll
36:09,379 --> 36:09,589
just write
36:09,589 --> 36:09,839
it that way.
36:09,839 --> 36:10,69
And
36:10,69 --> 36:10,349
what is
36:10,349 --> 36:10,599
this turns
36:10,599 --> 36:10,959
out to be
36:10,959 --> 36:11,239
a group with
36:11,239 --> 36:11,499
only
36:11,499 --> 36:11,739
finitely
36:11,739 --> 36:12,89
many elements
36:12,89 --> 36:12,519
in it
36:12,519 --> 36:12,689
because
36:12,689 --> 36:12,979
there are only
36:12,979 --> 36:13,259
finitely
36:13,259 --> 36:13,569
many ways
36:13,569 --> 36:13,919
you can permute
36:13,919 --> 36:14,249
n different
36:14,249 --> 36:14,589
objects.
36:14,589 --> 36:14,859
How many
36:14,859 --> 36:15,129
ways are there
36:15,129 --> 36:15,469
permuting
36:15,469 --> 36:15,799
n different
36:15,799 --> 36:16,99
objects?
36:16,99 --> 36:16,329
N factorial.
36:16,329 --> 36:16,539
Yeah,
36:16,539 --> 36:16,749
so this is
36:16,749 --> 36:16,999
a group
36:16,999 --> 36:17,299
where
36:17,299 --> 36:17,549
it's a finite
36:17,549 --> 36:17,949
group
36:17,949 --> 36:18,249
of
36:18,249 --> 36:18,519
order
36:18,519 --> 36:18,809
N
36:18,809 --> 36:19,139
factorial
36:19,139 --> 36:19,559
and you'll find
36:19,559 --> 36:19,859
that it's non-abelian
36:19,859 --> 36:20,179
and you should
36:20,179 --> 36:20,479
check that
36:20,479 --> 36:20,749
once
36:20,749 --> 36:21,69
n
36:21,69 --> 36:21,399
is at least
36:21,399 --> 36:21,719
three.
36:21,719 --> 36:21,919
So
36:21,919 --> 36:22,159
once
36:22,159 --> 36:22,359
there's a finite
36:22,359 --> 36:22,709
group with
36:22,709 --> 36:22,979
six elements
36:22,979 --> 36:23,359
in it,
36:23,359 --> 36:23,619
that's
36:23,619 --> 36:23,879
non-abelian.
36:23,879 --> 36:24,199
The
36:24,199 --> 36:24,509
permutations,
36:24,509 --> 36:24,859
the
36:24,859 --> 36:25,149
one to one
36:25,149 --> 36:25,389
maps
36:25,389 --> 36:25,689
of a set
36:25,689 --> 36:25,999
of three
36:25,999 --> 36:26,289
things to
36:26,289 --> 36:26,589
itself.
36:26,589 --> 36:26,789
And
36:26,789 --> 36:26,999
you should play
36:26,999 --> 36:27,329
with that
36:27,329 --> 36:27,599
a little bit.
36:27,599 --> 36:27,809
Okay,
36:27,809 --> 36:28,129
this is
36:28,129 --> 36:28,399
our introduction.
36:28,399 --> 36:28,699
This gives
36:28,699 --> 36:28,979
you an idea
36:28,979 --> 36:29,299
of what groups
36:29,299 --> 36:29,529
are.
36:29,529 --> 36:29,739
Peter
36:29,739 --> 36:29,979
has some
36:29,979 --> 36:30,279
interesting
36:30,279 --> 36:30,579
things. Are
36:30,579 --> 36:30,809
you want to put
36:30,809 --> 36:31,9
them on the board?
36:31,9 --> 36:31,169
Why not?
36:31,169 --> 36:31,399
So
36:31,399 --> 36:31,679
here's the homework.
36:31,679 --> 36:31,979
Recommended,
36:31,979 --> 36:32,389
optional.
36:32,389 --> 36:32,599
And
36:32,599 --> 36:32,779
it'll be
36:32,779 --> 36:33,9
on the web
36:33,9 --> 36:33,329
page for
36:33,329 --> 36:33,579
those of you
36:33,579 --> 36:33,809
who have to run
36:33,809 --> 36:34,99
now, but
36:34,99 --> 36:34,389
I'll put it on the
36:34,389 --> 36:34,609
blackboard
36:34,609 --> 36:34,879
too.
36:34,879 --> 36:35,109
This will give
36:35,109 --> 36:35,409
you an idea
36:35,409 --> 36:35,719
of whether
36:35,719 --> 36:35,999
you're up
36:35,999 --> 36:36,249
to speed,
36:36,249 --> 36:36,549
whether this
36:36,549 --> 36:36,829
is the right
36:36,829 --> 36:37,109
course for
36:37,109 --> 36:37,329
you.
36:37,329 --> 36:37,519
And if you want to
36:37,519 --> 36:37,769
talk to me
36:37,769 --> 36:38,39
or Peter
36:38,39 --> 36:38,299
about it,
36:38,299 --> 36:38,609
please do.
36:38,609 --> 36:38,819
So
36:38,819 --> 36:39,69
read
36:39,69 --> 36:39,539
1.1
36:39,539 --> 36:39,749
and
36:39,749 --> 36:40,29
pages
36:40,29 --> 36:40,319
38
36:40,319 --> 36:40,669
to 42
36:40,669 --> 36:40,929
and
36:40,929 --> 36:41,159
the exercises
36:41,159 --> 36:41,489
1.1.7
36:41,489 --> 36:41,809
1.1.16
36:41,809 --> 36:42,179
and
36:42,179 --> 36:42,439
1.1.17.
36:42,439 --> 36:42,729
Do
36:42,729 --> 36:42,949
those three
36:42,949 --> 36:43,279
exercises.
36:43,279 --> 36:43,609
If you want to
36:43,609 --> 36:43,829
hand it
36:43,829 --> 36:44,99
in,
36:44,99 --> 36:44,399
Peter
36:44,399 --> 36:44,659
or Peter will
36:44,659 --> 36:44,899
take a look
36:44,899 --> 36:45,139
at them for
36:45,139 --> 36:45,299
you.
36:45,299 --> 36:45,449
Okay?
36:45,449 --> 36:45,719
Thanks Peter.
36:45,719 --> 36:45,939
See
36:45,939 --> 36:46,199
you guys
36:46,199 --> 36:46,429
on Wednesday.
36:46,429 --> 36:46,649
I think
36:46,649 --> 36:46,819
it was good.
