1
00:00:12,328 --> 00:00:18,828
Reminder, the syllabus is posted on the web in in the course as part of the FAS webpage.

2
00:00:18,828 --> 00:00:25,388
Under math 122, the extension school syllabus is posted under E 222.

3
00:00:25,388 --> 00:00:27,138
Yeah. So what did they ask for login?

4
00:00:27,388 --> 00:00:31,698
Ah, it's I going to give you now it's described on the webpage how you log in.

5
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:36,658
As you as you get for the first two weeks, you log in under guest with no password.

6
00:00:36,658 --> 00:00:37,568
Okay.

7
00:00:37,568 --> 00:00:45,078
Eventually, we'll get the student IDs in the course and you'll log in as yourself. Initially, guest, password just leave it blank and you get in.

8
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:47,508
So it's essentially an open web page at the moment.

9
00:00:48,118 --> 00:00:48,758
Okay?

10
00:00:49,388 --> 00:00:58,408
Uh, you'll find the homework posted there, you'll find videos of the lectures posted there, you'll find uh notes from the lecture scanned in there.

11
00:00:58,668 --> 00:01:00,418
So a lot of information.

12
00:01:00,418 --> 00:01:15,388
And the way you'll find it is it'll open up, you can open up a calendar and in September, you can click on the date of the lecture, and then there are various choices labeled by letters, say H for homework and V for video and

13
00:01:16,198 --> 00:01:16,578
right?

14
00:01:16,768 --> 00:01:18,148
N for notes.

15
00:01:18,148 --> 00:01:27,968
And then you click on those and you see Peter's notes, or you see the video of me lecturing, or you can uh or you can get the homework assignment. We'll also post answers to the homework assignment there.

16
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:33,138
So the webpage should be up and functional. If you're having any problems with the web page, send email to Peter.

17
00:01:33,398 --> 00:01:38,538
We're also getting the CAs lined up in the course. We hope to have two CAs lined up for

18
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:44,488
the students taking this course 122 and one CA lined up for E 222.

19
00:01:44,488 --> 00:01:53,988
And please fill out, if you will, the section time preference survey on Tuesdays and Thursdays so we can find times to schedule those sections that agree with most of the people in the class.

20
00:01:54,408 --> 00:01:59,228
The homework, as I pointed out last time, will be assigned every lecture and due the next lecture.

21
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:03,368
You can hand them in today to Peter and he'll distribute them to get them graded.

22
00:02:03,628 --> 00:02:13,288
The homework for the extension course will be due weekly and uh you'll talk to JC Getz who is running the section for uh the extension school.

23
00:02:13,288 --> 00:02:18,448
I think I should talk to the camera when I talk to the extension school students because they're all out there in the wild blue Yonder. Yes.

24
00:02:18,548 --> 00:02:21,258
Jace. J.

25
00:02:21,588 --> 00:02:22,918
J, excuse me.

26
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:23,858
Jace.

27
00:02:24,268 --> 00:02:26,638
I'm always pronouncing the last letter of your name. I don't know why.

28
00:02:26,638 --> 00:02:28,188
I have a friend named JC.

29
00:02:28,518 --> 00:02:32,128
So I I transfer them to you. Jace gets.

30
00:02:32,128 --> 00:02:33,478
Thank you. I apologize.

31
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:39,258
Um, we'll introduce all the we'll introduce all the CAs on Friday once we have things finalized.

32
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:48,998
And the homework due next time, since I might as well put it up while we're talking about homework which you can find on the web page is to read sections 2.1 and 2.2

33
00:02:49,288 --> 00:02:56,038
in Arton Algebra which is the book.

34
00:02:56,038 --> 00:02:56,688
Okay.

35
00:02:57,338 --> 00:03:15,678
And the problems are 2.15 0.1.5, 2.1.7, 2.2.1, 2.2.15 and 2.2.20 part A.

36
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:17,898
Homework.

37
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,928
So that's what's do on Friday.

38
00:03:21,018 --> 00:03:23,488
Okay, so let's get to the lecture now.

39
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:29,058
So last time, I reviewed some concepts from linear algebra.

40
00:03:29,058 --> 00:03:29,508
Okay.

41
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:50,048
and defined our first group which was the group I called GLN of R, which is the set of all invertible N by N matrices

42
00:03:50,318 --> 00:04:00,518
A with entries AJ in the real numbers.

43
00:04:01,398 --> 00:04:16,088
You could also there are other groups you could do. If you didn't want to work with vector spaces over the real numbers, you could you could also define a group GLNC which would be the same thing where the entries of the matrix were complex numbers.

44
00:04:16,698 --> 00:04:34,598
Or you could define the group GLN Q This is complex numbers, this is the field of rational numbers. Same thing where the entries are rational numbers.

45
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:36,838
We'll start with the the real numbers.

46
00:04:37,128 --> 00:04:46,588
And and at the end, I talked about how this was uh in some sense contained in a rather natural group.

47
00:04:46,988 --> 00:04:52,868
And let's remember first of all what a group is. So having defined this, we we showed that it was a group.

48
00:04:52,868 --> 00:04:57,068
And a group is by definition

49
00:04:58,158 --> 00:05:02,078
Okay.

50
00:05:02,758 --> 00:05:09,288
All are groups G and group G is by definition one,

51
00:05:10,748 --> 00:05:17,528
a set with a product structure.

52
00:05:18,008 --> 00:05:29,768
So by that means, if you have two elements in the set, A and B are in the group, then you get a new element A. B, the product of A and B, which is a new element in the group.

53
00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:32,188
So there has to be a product.

54
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:41,078
And the second thing is the product must be associative. That's the most important thing to check.

55
00:05:41,328 --> 00:05:49,128
Namely A * B * c has to always equal A * B * c.

56
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:51,208
That's a tricky property.

57
00:05:51,988 --> 00:06:09,008
Uh, and Artin shows and you can go over his proof, it's a it's a somewhat meaningless proof by induction, but you should at least see it, that it once you have this associativity, then the product of any n elements in the group is well-defined independent of the order that you take the product.

58
00:06:09,008 --> 00:06:12,978
Once you have associativity for three elements, you have it for more than three elements.

59
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:19,808
And the second condition is the existence of an identity, which I'll denote E.

60
00:06:20,348 --> 00:06:27,808
which has the property that the product of any element with the identity, the product of the identity element with is A.

61
00:06:28,118 --> 00:06:35,088
So every element, no matter how you product it with the identity, gives you itself. And the fourth condition is the existence of inverse.

62
00:06:35,578 --> 00:06:42,138
And that means that for every element, there's an inverse, which denoted A inverse in the group,

63
00:06:42,388 --> 00:06:50,368
with the property that no matter how you multiply A by A inverse in either order, you get back to the identity.

64
00:06:51,468 --> 00:06:56,428
Those are the properties that characterize a group, rather simple properties.

65
00:06:56,968 --> 00:07:03,648
Uh, and we saw that the matrices which were invertible formed a group under matrix multiplication.

66
00:07:04,788 --> 00:07:09,498
Okay.

67
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:29,068
Sociativity is rather difficult to check from the definition of matrix multiplication, but if you think of matrices as representing linear operators and multiplication being composition of linear operators, I'll leave this up as the homework for next time for those who come late.

68
00:07:30,338 --> 00:07:35,088
Uh then it's clear that the composition of three operators is the same, no matter how you compose them.

69
00:07:35,518 --> 00:07:40,788
The identity element is the identity matrix with all ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.

70
00:07:40,788 --> 00:07:47,448
And the inverse element is the inverse matrix, and that's why we had to assume that we only took invertible matrices here.

71
00:07:48,098 --> 00:07:58,478
And I also ended with the prototypical example of a group, even more prototypical than this example, uh, which is the automorphisms of a set.

72
00:07:59,008 --> 00:08:09,508
Uh, the the Ur group, I'll call it, Ur being the city in which uh which all started is the um

73
00:08:11,418 --> 00:08:18,728
is the symmetries of a set T. This is just an arbitrary set.

74
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:22,228
And the symmetries of a set are all bijections of T.

75
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:30,238
Okay.

76
00:08:30,868 --> 00:08:34,488
Bijection meaning a one-to-one onto map of the set to itself.

77
00:08:34,878 --> 00:08:46,108
And the group operation is composition. So A. B of an element T is by definition A of B of T.

78
00:08:46,348 --> 00:08:47,438
That's how we're going to do it.

79
00:08:47,438 --> 00:08:52,068
So first apply B to the set, that gives you a new element in the set, then apply A to that element.

80
00:08:52,068 --> 00:08:58,268
That gives you a third element of the set. That's the that's the mapping that A. B does to the set.

81
00:08:58,428 --> 00:09:03,068
And you check that the composition of bijections is a bijection.

82
00:09:03,398 --> 00:09:08,508
However, it needn't be equal to the composition in the opposite order, as we're going to see.

83
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:17,468
Uh, the identity element is just the the bijection that takes every element in the set to itself.

84
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:27,538
And the inverse element A inverse is defined as the element that takes the element A of T back to the element T.

85
00:09:27,538 --> 00:09:38,078
And since every element in the set can be written as A of T uniquely because A was a bijection, this defines a bijection of the set T, and it clearly has the property

86
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:41,408
that when you compose it with A, you get the E.

87
00:09:41,838 --> 00:09:44,608
You have to check in the opposite direction, but it also works.

88
00:09:45,678 --> 00:09:46,058
Excuse me.

89
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:46,938
Please.

90
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,888
You use the term automorphism?

91
00:09:49,128 --> 00:09:54,508
Uh, automorphism is the same as bijection. I'm sorry if I used that term, but we might as well get into it.

92
00:09:54,798 --> 00:09:58,418
So morphism in mathematics means a map between sets.

93
00:09:58,858 --> 01:01,798
An automorphism means a bijective map.

94
01:02,088 --> 01:15,698
So sometimes people will refer to this group as the automorphism group of T, all automorphisms of the set T.

95
01:16,278 --> 01:18,938
Automorphism is exactly the same word as bijection.

96
01:20,518 --> 01:22,968
It's a little bit more Greek. Okay?

97
01:23,788 --> 01:24,828
Good.

98
01:24,828 --> 01:28,248
Please just stop me. I'm going to sometimes slip into jargon.

99
01:28,248 --> 01:34,848
Part of this part of this uh course is so you can speak enough jargon to sound like a mathematician and confuse everyone else.

100
01:35,278 --> 01:43,638
One of the things that mathematicians found out when they started talking to theoretical physicists over the last 30 years is that we were doing exactly the same thing but had different words for it.

101
01:44,078 --> 01:50,528
So when physicists said things like D brain, mathematicians would say, but that's just a manifold.

102
01:51,078 --> 01:54,998
So a lot of it is learning the difference the words that are used to express the same thing.

103
01:55,738 --> 01:56,358
Okay?

104
01:56,788 --> 02:03,248
So this is this is some sense the or group, almost all groups come in some way from the symmetries of a set.

105
02:03,248 --> 02:13,818
For example, this group is contained in the automorphisms or the symmetries, sorry, of the set R to the N.

106
02:14,478 --> 02:18,938
Namely, these are certain bijections of the set R to the end.

107
02:18,938 --> 02:22,158
They're the bijections that preserve the linear structure.

108
02:22,798 --> 02:26,078
Right? That's when you get a matrix, when you have a linear transformation.

109
02:26,078 --> 02:34,528
You could have other maps of the real line to itself that weren't necessarily of the form X goes to AX.

110
02:35,458 --> 02:36,038
Right?

111
02:36,898 --> 02:44,128
You could have for example, the bijection X goes to X cubed. That's a bijection of the real line to itself.

112
02:44,878 --> 02:55,338
So, there are more symmetries of Rn that are contained in N by N matrices, but these are certainly a subset of this. And in fact, they're what we call a subgroup.

113
02:55,688 --> 03:13,238
So that's another definition to learn. A subgroup H of a group G denoted like that is a subset that is closed under multiplication, contains the identity and contains inverses.

114
03:13,588 --> 03:29,178
So it should be closed under it's a subset which is closed under multiplication, contains the identity

115
03:29,628 --> 03:31,958
and closed under inverses.

116
03:32,298 --> 03:37,648
Namely, if A is in H, A inverse also has to be in H.

117
03:38,148 --> 03:48,008
So let's observe that this is a subgroup of this. I have all the bijections of RN, and then they have the ones which are the linear bijections.

118
03:48,798 --> 03:57,208
of RN. There were the ones that are represented by n by n invertible matrices.

119
03:57,488 --> 04:03,558
Let's see, if I have two linear bijections and I compose them, I get a third linear map.

120
04:03,858 --> 04:10,678
That's closed under multiplication because remember, multiplication here is composition of maps.

121
04:10,978 --> 04:18,238
Does it contain the identity map that takes every vector to itself? You bet. That's given by the identity matrix. Okay?

122
04:20,628 --> 04:24,478
If an element is linear, is its inverse linear?

123
04:24,478 --> 04:25,038
Yes.

124
04:25,848 --> 04:33,508
Consequently, this subset is closed under multiplication, it contains the identity, it contains inverses, it's a subgroup of this.

125
04:33,508 --> 04:40,688
We're going to see all kinds of examples of groups defined as subgroups of the symmetry group of a set by putting more conditions on it.

126
04:40,688 --> 04:46,088
It not only takes elements of the set to itself, but it preserves this structure on the set.

127
04:46,568 --> 04:48,678
That's the usual way you get a group. Okay?

128
04:49,578 --> 04:59,608
And this is the way they appear in mathematics because you whenever you have a mathematical object or in physics, for example, the group theory exploded in physics in the 20th century when

129
04:59,608 --> 05:05,018
people started to realize that the forces operating on an object might be radially symmetric.

130
05:06,378 --> 05:07,998
See, that's an extra symmetry.

131
05:07,998 --> 05:13,498
So you want to exploit the fact that you have a group acting on the set that you're studying.

132
05:13,918 --> 05:17,548
So this is this is the way groups really appear, not as not as symbols.

133
05:17,548 --> 05:25,298
So, as I ended last time with the with the famous example, which is the way courses on group theory usually start, although Artin

134
05:25,708 --> 05:38,148
very wisely identifies these uh these matrix groups as more fundamental and they are, they come up much more in mathematics because linear algebra is is the central subject of mathematics.

135
05:38,148 --> 05:40,608
You cannot learn too much linear algebra.

136
05:40,608 --> 05:44,978
That's a basic principle for all of you going on in mathematics. Linear algebra is presented as sort of stupid stuff.

137
05:44,978 --> 05:47,488
You cannot learn too much linear algebra.

138
05:48,118 --> 05:59,738
So here's the here's a nice group called SN, which is the symmetry group of the set 1, 2, 3 N - 1 N. The set, a finite set of N elements.

139
06:01,078 --> 06:04,658
sometimes called the permutation group on n letters.

140
06:04,658 --> 06:06,528
Okay.

141
06:11,058 --> 06:16,558
Because an automorphism of this set just reassigns the reassigns the places in line.

142
06:17,478 --> 06:27,808
And we saw that this is a finite group because there are only finitely many permutations of a set of N letters.

143
06:27,808 --> 06:35,508
And the order of it, that's the size of the the set underlying the group, N factorial.

144
06:35,508 --> 06:38,778
I might write that this way. This is the way Art write that.

145
06:38,778 --> 06:42,318
The order of the symmetry group SN is n factorial.

146
06:42,318 --> 06:46,088
Because there are n factorial ways to permute n letters.

147
06:46,278 --> 06:55,668
Why? Because there are n choices for the letter you take first, and then there are n - 1 choices for the letter you take second, and then there are n - 2 choices for the letter you take third.

148
06:56,788 --> 06:57,278
Okay.

149
06:57,868 --> 07:04,308
Let's take a look at the symmetric group on a few small letters to get an idea how we would analyze it.

150
07:04,308 --> 07:06,528
So the simplest one is S1.

151
07:07,148 --> 07:12,988
S1 is a very simple group because the only permutation of a set of one element is the identity.

152
07:13,808 --> 07:15,368
So there it's that's a famous group.

153
07:15,748 --> 07:24,408
That's the simplest group you can have because any group has to contain an identity element, which happens to be its own inverse and etc, etc, etc.

154
07:25,328 --> 07:28,038
So that's an easy group. has one element in it.

155
07:28,038 --> 07:36,408
You can't have you can have a set with zero elements, right? The empty set, but you can't have a group with zero elements. Simplest group you have is one element.

156
07:36,918 --> 07:38,418
How about S2?

157
07:38,788 --> 07:46,688
Well, there's the identity map that takes let's let's denote a let's write our permutation like this. This would be the identity permutation.

158
07:47,748 --> 07:56,168
takes one to one and two to two. But there's another element in this group that takes one to two and takes two to one.

159
07:56,938 --> 07:59,988
Let's call that permutation Tau.

160
08:01,508 --> 08:07,218
Okay, so S2 is a set which has two elements in it, E and Tau.

161
08:08,298 --> 08:11,448
Those are the only possible permutations of two letters.

162
08:11,778 --> 08:14,198
And we want to know what the multiplication law is.

163
08:14,528 --> 08:27,498
Well, if we compose any any permutation with the identity permutation, we get itself. So obviously you have E tau is equal to tau E is equal to E is equal to tau.

164
08:28,728 --> 08:31,918
And what about if I compose Tau with Tau?

165
08:33,338 --> 08:34,348
It's E.

166
08:34,858 --> 08:43,548
If I if I do this twice, so I take one to two, then I take two to one, it goes back to one, and then I take two to one, and I do it again, one goes to two, so two goes to two.

167
08:44,158 --> 08:52,898
So, here I have this law. So in other words, Tau in this group is equal to tau inverse because it is the transformation that multiplies by tau to get E.

168
08:54,258 --> 08:55,798
So that's a pretty simple group.

169
08:55,798 --> 09:03,108
It has two elements in it, the identity and a non- identity element. And the non- identity element when I multiply by itself, I get back to E.

170
09:03,588 --> 09:12,238
So the multiplication table, if you really wanted to write this thing out, which I don't recommend ever doing, would look like this.

171
09:13,828 --> 09:14,368
Okay.

172
09:15,208 --> 09:21,018
Now, that's an example of a group that I called last time, Abelian or commutative.

173
09:21,318 --> 09:30,908
So if AB is equal to BA for all pairs, say G is a billion

174
09:36,118 --> 09:39,058
or commutative.

175
09:40,628 --> 09:46,518
Some people capitalize a billion in honor of Able, some people don't. doesn't make any difference to me.

176
09:47,908 --> 09:56,238
So, uh this group is commutative. Commutative group just means that the multiplication table is symmetric across around the diagonal, and this one is.

177
09:58,018 --> 10:05,028
Let's take an example which is a little bit more interesting where we go to the permutations of three elements.

178
10:07,458 --> 10:08,758
I'm now going to erase the homework.

179
10:09,398 --> 10:11,598
In fact, I'm going to erase the definition of a group.

180
10:12,118 --> 10:12,678
Okay.

181
10:34,838 --> 10:35,458
Okay.

182
10:35,778 --> 10:38,028
S3. So, of course, we have the identity element.

183
10:38,028 --> 10:39,578
That one we already knew about.

184
10:40,128 --> 10:52,398
Now, we have an element like this Tau, namely, we can forget about the fact that we have three elements, leave the third element fixed and just permute the first two.

185
10:52,398 --> 10:55,078
like that. Let's call that element Tau. We've already seen that element.

186
10:56,088 --> 11:02,408
Now, elements in the symmetric this is by the way called the symmetric group or permutation group on n letters.

187
11:03,098 --> 11:07,688
symmetric group on n letters.

188
11:08,338 --> 11:17,998
I'm sorry for all these different terminologies for the same thing like automorphisms and symmetries, but um, it's good to at least know what they are.

189
11:17,998 --> 11:25,178
People only realized how fundamental a group was at the end of the 19th century and already they had a lot of different language for it. So we at least have to know what the words are.

190
11:26,778 --> 11:38,228
Um, if you have this kind of symmetries where you only exchange two elements, well, that was obvious in this case, are called transpositions.

191
11:38,228 --> 11:40,538
Okay.

192
11:50,678 --> 12:03,508
So, if if you have a a very simple type of of uh permutation is to fix everything but two elements and just exchange those two. Those are called transpositions. They're very important as we'll see later on in the theory of the symmetric group.

193
12:03,898 --> 12:09,418
Now, in this case, we have this transposition, but we also have some others. Can someone tell me some other transpositions in the symmetric group on three letters?

194
12:11,148 --> 12:12,528
Yeah.

195
12:12,838 --> 12:18,888
the one that maps one to one, takes two to three, three to two. Right.

196
12:19,628 --> 12:26,118
So there are three different elements we could fix, right? We could fix three, but we could also fix two, we could also fix one.

197
12:26,458 --> 12:36,078
So uh there are actually three transpositions. I'll write them down. So we could fix one and switch two and three.

198
12:36,078 --> 12:50,408
Let's call that one Tau prime. Or we could exchange one and three and fix two. Those are all three different. I could call that Tau double prime.

199
12:51,998 --> 12:57,898
So, so far we've found four different permutations of the set of three elements. We ultimately have to find three factorial, which is six.

200
12:57,898 --> 13:04,268
So there have to be two more permutations of three elements. So I'll write you down a new another one that isn't a transposition.

201
13:04,268 --> 13:18,228
If it's not a transposition, it can't fix anything because there're only three elements. So once it fixed one element, it would have to either fix them all or or just exchange the other two. We've already written down all of those.

202
13:20,758 --> 13:29,098
Well, we can take one to two and two to three and three back to one. Let's call that one sigma.

203
13:31,708 --> 13:48,998
Or another possibility, instead of taking one to two, we could take one to three, right? Then we could take two, I guess it would have to go to um to one and three goes to two.

204
13:49,338 --> 13:51,378
Let's call that one sigma prime.

205
13:52,618 --> 14:02,528
So we have three transpositions, the identity element, and these two elements that don't fix anything, but represent different permutations. So those are the six elements of S3.

206
14:03,138 --> 14:09,398
E tau tau prime, tau double prime, sigma sigma prime.

207
14:11,358 --> 14:13,478
Now, the fun starts.

208
14:13,828 --> 14:20,728
Let's see if we can find let's see what the composition of these things looks like. In particular, let's see if this group is uh commutative.

209
14:25,308 --> 14:31,448
So, let us compute Tau sigma and let us then compute sigma Tau.

210
14:32,238 --> 14:37,498
Now, how do you compute tau sigma? Well, you have to figure out what it is as a permutation of the set of three elements.

211
14:37,498 --> 14:41,898
So the first thing I'd want to know is what does it do to the element one? Okay?

212
14:43,138 --> 14:44,658
Well, let's figure that out.

213
14:44,658 --> 14:52,078
This says, first now this notation means, first apply sigma to one and then apply Tau to what sigma takes one two.

214
14:52,588 --> 14:56,208
So this becomes Tau of sigma of one.

215
14:56,658 --> 15:00,488
Sigma of one is by definition two.

216
15:00,488 --> 15:01,088
Right?

217
15:02,218 --> 15:11,528
And Tau of two is one. So this becomes Tau of two which becomes one.

218
15:12,248 --> 15:16,868
So this permutation, whatever it does, it fixes one.

219
15:17,928 --> 15:19,858
It fixes the element one.

220
15:19,858 --> 15:21,788
Now I can tell you right away what it is.

221
15:22,258 --> 15:27,478
There are only two of these six permutations that fix the element one. What are they?

222
15:28,168 --> 15:29,358
E and tau prime.

223
15:30,138 --> 15:32,018
It could be E.

224
15:33,578 --> 15:42,708
So Tau sigma is either E or Tau prime.

225
15:43,978 --> 15:54,048
Now, I claim that it isn't E. Then I can tell you right away without even thinking about it, by pure thought, that it isn't E, without computing what it does to two.

226
15:54,488 --> 15:57,708
Now, I could check by just seeing what it did to two.

227
15:58,078 --> 16:01,718
Let's do that. That's the that's the computational approach.

228
16:01,718 --> 16:04,878
Proof. Tau sigma of two.

229
16:05,208 --> 16:14,048
Well, we first compute sigma of 2, that's three, it's tau of three. and tau of three happens to be three.

230
16:14,048 --> 16:14,758
Okay?

231
16:16,188 --> 16:22,448
So, it's beginning to look much more like tau prime, because it fixed one and it took two to three.

232
16:22,448 --> 16:26,558
Now that says it has to take three to whatever whatever's left because it's a bijection.

233
16:26,938 --> 16:31,908
So that that immediately implies that tau sigma is equal to tau prime.

234
16:32,638 --> 16:33,138
Okay?

235
16:34,158 --> 16:37,688
That's the that's our multiplication table. We're starting to work out. But...

236
16:37,988 --> 16:42,428
if I wanted to do it by pure thought, without ever computing what it did to two.

237
16:42,428 --> 16:49,198
How do you think I could eliminate the fact that Tau sigma could not be equal to E, given the fact that this is a group? Yeah, go ahead.

238
16:49,908 --> 16:51,988
Because sigma is not the inverse of tau. Ah!

239
16:52,598 --> 16:55,948
They're clearly not inverses of each other.

240
16:55,948 --> 16:57,448
What is the inverse to Tau?

241
16:58,218 --> 16:58,968
Tau. Tau.

242
16:59,498 --> 17:00,658
That's all you have to say.

243
17:00,968 --> 17:07,278
Inverses are unique. The only possible thing that when you multiply by tau, you get back to the identity is tau.

244
17:07,818 --> 17:10,658
Sigma doesn't look like Tau.

245
17:11,408 --> 17:24,268
So, but you could also argue very good that the inverse of Tau is equal to Tau.

246
17:24,268 --> 17:26,148
By the way, what's the inverse of Sigma?

247
17:27,188 --> 17:31,298
Can anyone tell me what the inverse of Sigma is? Sigma prime. Ah, very good.

248
17:32,248 --> 17:46,798
Sigma inverse is equal to sigma prime. If you look at it, if you want to get this back to where you started, you have to take two to one, you have to take one to three, and you have to take three to two. That's what sigma prime is.

249
17:47,888 --> 17:54,638
So, with these six elements, this is just the fun, you know, now you can start taking products and inverses, but in any case,

250
17:54,998 --> 17:58,758
we've computed that Tau Sigma is Tau prime.

251
17:59,428 --> 18:02,348
We've got that. Let's now compute what sigma Tau is.

252
18:02,998 --> 18:06,148
Well we'll compute sigma Tau by computing it on one.

253
18:07,668 --> 18:10,498
Okay, we start off by tau of 1 is two.

254
18:10,768 --> 18:12,548
So this is sigma of two.

255
18:13,858 --> 18:16,818
And sigma of two is three.

256
18:17,418 --> 18:20,828
So sigma Tau of one is three.

257
18:21,768 --> 18:22,518
Interesting.

258
18:22,938 --> 18:32,468
So there are two possibilities for it. It could be it could be tau double prime, or it could be sigma prime.

259
18:32,948 --> 18:34,688
We're again down to two possibilities.

260
18:35,348 --> 18:41,458
Well, let's compute sigma tau of two just to just to to kill the suspense of it all.

261
18:41,458 --> 18:46,848
Tau of 2 is one, so this becomes sigma of one. Sigma of one is two.

262
18:47,298 --> 18:53,568
So, it fixes two and therefore it's equal to tau double prime, right?

263
18:54,078 --> 18:57,728
So therefore sigma Tau is equal to Tau double prime.

264
18:58,588 --> 19:02,578
Here, fixes two, takes one to three. Okay?

265
19:03,758 --> 19:07,618
And therefore, sigma Tau is not equal to Tau sigma.

266
19:07,618 --> 19:09,138
Okay.

267
19:12,028 --> 19:19,138
So already in this incredibly simple permutation group on three elements, it's non-abelian.

268
19:19,758 --> 19:20,408
Okay?

269
19:21,148 --> 19:26,278
Corry, let's let's push our luck. Corry,

270
19:27,208 --> 19:41,618
the group SN, the symmetric group on n letters is non-abelian for all N larger than or equal to three.

271
19:42,428 --> 19:47,048
So once we permute more than three elements, we have a non-abelian group.

272
19:47,698 --> 19:53,738
Well, what are we going to do? Are we going to write down all the n factorial things and find two things that don't commute? Let's think for a second.

273
19:54,838 --> 19:56,218
Let's think for a second.

274
19:57,528 --> 19:58,908
Did you want to say something?

275
19:59,728 --> 20:06,518
How can we exhibit, how can we prove this corollary just from this stupid computation? Go ahead.

276
20:07,718 --> 20:10,608
Fix all the elements after three. Bravo! Excellent! Proof.

277
20:13,048 --> 20:28,738
S3 is a subgroup of SN fixing the the letters 4, 5, 6 up to N.

278
20:28,738 --> 20:44,238
Namely, if I take inside of the permutation group, the subset of permutations that fix all the letters after three, then that is the permutation group on three letters because all I have left is to arrange how I permute the first three letters around.

279
20:45,278 --> 20:47,478
Right? And that's a subgroup of SN.

280
20:47,478 --> 20:52,788
Because if I compose two permutations that fix all this letters, they still fix it.

281
20:52,988 --> 20:58,068
If I take the inverse of something that fixes these letters, it still fixes it, and the identity element fixes them.

282
20:58,408 --> 20:59,898
So this is a subgroup.

283
21:00,508 --> 21:04,478
Once N is bigger than or equal to three, S3 is a subgroup of SN.

284
21:04,798 --> 21:11,038
I have two elements in S3 that don't commute, namely Sigma and Tau, and those give me elements in SN that don't commute.

285
21:11,038 --> 21:19,938
Namely, just take these poor permutations Sigma and Tau and extend them to permutations of the whole set that fix 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 up to n.

286
21:20,858 --> 21:23,898
Okay? So you already see that subgroups are very good.

287
21:23,898 --> 21:27,978
If you can find a subgroup of a group that's non-abelian, the group is non-abelian.

288
21:27,978 --> 21:31,268
Because all you have to do is find two elements in the group that don't commute.

289
21:31,688 --> 21:35,508
And if you can find two elements in the subgroup that don't commute, they certainly don't commute in the group.

290
21:36,378 --> 21:40,688
Because their products are different elements of the subgroup, so they're different elements in the group.

291
21:41,778 --> 21:42,438
Okay?

292
21:43,998 --> 21:44,978
Excuse me.

293
21:45,138 --> 21:45,408
Please.

294
21:46,098 --> 21:51,048
Sorry, I think I sort of missed something a second ago when you were talking about the secondary way to see that

295
21:51,408 --> 21:56,148
How to argue that sigma Tau Tau Sigma is not equal to the identity?

296
21:56,518 --> 22:06,948
Okay, if it were equal to the identity, then sigma would be an inverse to Tau, because the inverse is the unique element in the group that the product hits the identity.

297
22:07,338 --> 22:12,718
If it were the identity, that would say sigma is tau inverse. But looking at them, they're not inverses of each other.

298
22:13,078 --> 22:15,638
Because the inverse to a transposition is itself.

299
22:16,018 --> 22:19,368
If you have a transposition, then you find Tau is equal to Tau inverse.

300
22:20,158 --> 22:22,978
For all transpositions, you have that property.

301
22:23,338 --> 22:28,218
Whereas here, we didn't find sigma is equal to sigma inverse. Its inverse was sigma prime.

302
22:29,408 --> 22:32,268
Okay? I'll do one more example of a subgroup for you.

303
22:33,008 --> 22:40,858
So here we saw we got a subgroup by asking that it permuted something, but it fixed something inside of that set.

304
22:41,138 --> 22:43,288
That's a very good way of getting subgroups.

305
22:43,538 --> 22:58,428
For example, I claim that for any K less than or equal to n, SK is a subgroup of SN.

306
22:58,748 --> 23:02,668
Same argument. It fixes all the letters past K.

307
23:03,278 --> 23:14,538
permutations fixing K + 1, K + 2 up to n.

308
23:15,478 --> 23:16,178
Okay?

309
23:16,658 --> 23:24,828
So you very frequently get subgroups by insisting that they fix something, and then when you compose two symmetries that fix something, it fixes something, etc.

310
23:25,168 --> 23:26,928
Let's do that inside of GLN.

311
23:27,198 --> 23:39,588
So what is the subgroup of GL2R which fixes the line, if I if I view GL2R is acting on R2,

312
23:40,438 --> 23:53,118
what about the subgroup of linear transformations that fix this line? So the line uh where Y equals 0.

313
23:58,118 --> 23:59,128
Okay.

314
24:00,678 --> 24:03,018
What is the subgroup that fixes that line?

315
24:03,438 --> 24:05,238
Well, let's think about it in matrix form.

316
24:07,018 --> 24:18,538
Now, you can see right away that that has to be a subgroup, regardless of what the matrices in it look like, because these are linear maps of R2 to itself, which are bijections.

317
24:18,878 --> 24:23,948
If they fix this line and you compose two bijections fixing this line, it fixes the line.

318
24:24,148 --> 24:33,658
Fixing the line means, by the way, just keeping the line on itself. It it might move a vector here to a vector here or something, but it but at least it stabilizes the line.

319
24:34,438 --> 24:40,348
Maybe I should use that expression so that we don't get we don't think it fixes every vector on the line.

320
24:40,348 --> 24:41,788
stabilizing.

321
24:42,208 --> 24:46,888
That's clearly a subgroup because composition of two things that stabilize this line, stabilizes the line.

322
24:47,138 --> 24:52,238
If a map stabilizes this line, so does its inverse. The identity certainly stabilizes this line.

323
24:53,238 --> 24:56,788
Okay? So there is some subgroup. What does it look like matricially?

324
24:57,658 --> 24:58,218
Okay?

325
24:58,488 --> 25:07,748
So if you have a matrix ABCD, which is invertible, what does it mean that it fixes the first basis vector?

326
25:07,748 --> 25:11,838
It means that the entry B in the matrix is zero.

327
25:12,698 --> 25:13,328
Right?

328
25:13,598 --> 25:22,118
Because this column represents the transformation on the first basis vector, and this column represents the transformation on the second basis vector.

329
25:22,428 --> 25:29,368
And to say that the linear transformation fixes this line says it takes the first basis vector into some multiple of the first basis vector.

330
25:30,228 --> 25:37,978
Right? So the coefficient of the second basis vector in the matrix would be zero by the way we represent linear transformations by matrices.

331
25:38,608 --> 25:43,858
So a matrix will fix this line if and only if the B entry is zero.

332
25:44,278 --> 25:52,738
And then we want it to be invertible, so that just means that it's determinant is non zero. So AD is not equal to zero.

333
25:53,478 --> 25:57,988
That's the subgroup of 2x2 matrices that fix the line.

334
25:58,318 --> 26:03,388
And then we better check that it's closed under multiplication, huh? I mean, we might have gotten it wrong.

335
26:03,728 --> 26:13,918
So we better check that if we multiply two matrices that look like this, we get another matrix that looks like this.

336
26:14,668 --> 26:16,258
Well, do you believe it?

337
26:16,908 --> 26:26,148
We just have to check that this bottom entry is zero. So there's only one thing to check. So we have to go across this row and down this column and verify that the product is zero.

338
26:26,148 --> 26:34,078
And you get 0 * a prime plus d * 0. So the entry here is zero. It's sort of irrelevant what goes up here.

339
26:34,328 --> 26:37,068
So that shows that those matrices are closed under product.

340
26:37,348 --> 26:37,608
Yes.

341
26:38,128 --> 26:42,098
Wouldn't you have to check that the other corners are non-zero either? Very good point.

342
26:42,098 --> 26:49,138
But we know that because the product of two matrices with non-zero determinant have non-zero determinant.

343
26:49,138 --> 26:52,648
That's already the fact that it's a subset of GL2.

344
26:53,208 --> 26:58,338
This condition will be But you're you're absolutely right. In fact, why don't we check and see what the corners are just to just to verify that for ourselves.

345
26:58,768 --> 27:03,488
So this corner is A a prime.

346
27:04,548 --> 27:07,188
And this corner happens to be D D prime.

347
27:07,928 --> 27:17,958
And this thing is much more complicated. And certainly, if A * D and A prime * D prime are non zero, so is A A prime * D D prime. But good question.

348
27:18,828 --> 27:20,088
Okay? Good question.

349
27:21,698 --> 27:23,268
All set with this?

350
27:23,678 --> 27:27,428
So start to recognize subgroups. That's a that's a really big point. Now,

351
27:27,638 --> 27:34,538
Artin has a very nice exercise where he shows you what the subgroups are of the additive group of the integers. Let's do that.

352
27:35,028 --> 27:42,388
Sometimes it's possible in a group, very rarely, but sometimes it's possible to identify all the subgroups.

353
27:42,388 --> 27:43,168
Okay?

354
27:44,418 --> 27:47,328
So here's a proposition I'll prove for you.

355
27:47,328 --> 27:48,288
Proposition.

356
27:49,108 --> 28:19,978
The collection the subgroups of the integers under addition, that's an abelian group, are precisely given by BZ all multiples of a fixed integer under addition.

357
28:20,798 --> 28:21,658
or multiple

358
28:28,058 --> 28:28,428
Okay.

359
28:29,548 --> 28:35,478
So uh all even integers or all integers divisible by three or all integers divisible by five.

360
28:36,078 --> 28:39,578
So we're going to check that that forms a subgroup and then we're going to prove that every subgroup has that form.

361
28:40,008 --> 28:49,408
By the way, I should have said in the definition of a subgroup, a mathematician gives you a definition, he should always follow it by the trivial examples.

362
28:49,948 --> 28:50,938
Right? Sometimes they're no more examples.

363
28:51,958 --> 28:54,218
Then it was a stupid definition.

364
28:55,028 --> 28:59,608
So, who can give me two completely trivial subgroups of any group? Yeah.

365
29:00,638 --> 29:03,048
the identity group and the entire group. Perfect.

366
29:03,538 --> 29:13,088
So anytime you have a group, it forms a subgroup of itself. You didn't really need the notation to tell you that, but it's certainly closed under addition, identity, etc. And that's the biggest subgroup you can have.

367
29:15,678 --> 29:24,058
And the smallest subgroup you can have is when you have just the identity element, because it must contain the identity element. And then the subgroup is like the group with one element.

368
29:24,428 --> 29:25,808
Closed under Okay?

369
29:26,088 --> 29:27,428
So you always have those two subgroups.

370
29:27,758 --> 29:33,578
Now, where are those two subgroups here? Which subgroup here is the identity element and which subgroup is the full group?

371
29:34,748 --> 29:36,968
Yeah, let's follow up. Go ahead. B equals zero. Good.

372
29:38,348 --> 29:49,568
B equals 0 gives the group zero under addition, which is just the the one element group.

373
29:50,168 --> 29:55,488
And B equal 1 gives h equal G.

374
29:55,488 --> 30:05,528
Because if you just take multiples of one. But the others are non-trivial subgroups, even integers, integers divisible by three, integers divisible by 17, integers divisible by 21. Okay, proof.

375
30:07,308 --> 30:07,618
Okay.

376
30:08,478 --> 30:14,008
First, these are all subgroups.

377
30:16,668 --> 30:19,828
That's more or less clear.

378
30:19,828 --> 30:29,548
If you add two integers divisible by B, that's just things like this. B M + Bn is equal to B * M + n.

379
30:30,508 --> 30:36,018
Right? The negative of BM is B * minus M.

380
30:36,458 --> 30:40,308
And 0 is equal to 0 * is equal to B * 0.

381
30:41,048 --> 30:49,208
So that shows that the zero element is in the group. This shows that we have inverses in the group, and this shows that the group is closed under addition.

382
30:49,208 --> 30:50,018
Okay?

383
30:50,708 --> 30:57,598
So anything, all integers divisible by something give a subgroup of all integers under addition.

384
30:57,888 --> 31:01,438
We just have to show that these are the only possible subgroups.

385
31:01,438 --> 31:02,008
Okay?

386
31:02,698 --> 31:13,128
So, to show that these exhaust the subgroups, we're going to use a trick that goes back to book five and Euclid.

387
31:13,468 --> 31:26,008
So we to show these exhaust the subgroups exhaust the subgroups, let

388
31:27,098 --> 31:41,258
H be a subgroup of Z and let let B be equal to the smallest integer. Well, there are two cases.

389
31:43,078 --> 31:45,438
Case 1. H is equal to 0.

390
31:45,438 --> 31:46,578
Okay.

391
31:47,138 --> 31:51,238
So it's the zero subgroup. Well, that's one of these cases.

392
31:51,238 --> 31:55,968
with B equals 0. So that's okay.

393
31:56,898 --> 32:04,658
Case two, H is not equal to the zero group. So it contains something other than the identity in it.

394
32:05,388 --> 32:10,108
Now, by taking inverses, we see that it has to contain something positive in it.

395
32:10,638 --> 32:16,068
So contains an M not equal to zero.

396
32:16,788 --> 32:29,218
Taking M or minus M in H, we see it contains some integer M which is strictly greater than zero.

397
32:31,058 --> 32:32,348
strictly greater than zero.

398
32:33,898 --> 32:42,368
Because it's closed under inverses. So if if you found it contain minus 3, it would also have to contain three.

399
32:43,498 --> 32:44,208
Okay?

400
32:44,828 --> 32:58,398
And then the trick of the Euclidean algorithm is to let B be the smallest possible integer, B greater than zero, B the smallest positive integer contained in H.

401
32:59,428 --> 33:00,338
Okay.

402
33:02,078 --> 33:06,598
Okay? So since it contains positive integers, it contains a smallest one.

403
33:12,008 --> 33:13,128
Okay?

404
33:14,008 --> 33:20,638
Then the first observation is then H contains all multiples of B.

405
33:21,548 --> 33:31,598
Because once it has B in it, it has B + B, which is 2B, and then it has B + B + B, which is 3B, right? And then it has minus B, which is the inverse of B, then it has minus 2B, which is the inverse of 2B.

406
33:31,598 --> 33:35,358
Everyone agree to that? So once we find the smallest positive integer in it,

407
33:35,948 --> 33:51,658
it has to contain all multiples of this by closure under addition and inversion.

408
33:52,608 --> 33:55,318
Okay? Now suppose there was something else in H.

409
33:55,788 --> 34:00,928
Suppose H is in H.

410
34:01,938 --> 34:12,818
And write h as some multiple of B plus a remainder term with 0 less than or equal to R less than B.

411
34:13,548 --> 34:16,158
We can do that by the Euclidean algorithm.

412
34:16,438 --> 34:23,178
You can always subtract off some multiple of B from your integer that's in the group that makes the remainder less than B.

413
34:23,178 --> 34:46,958
If you think of the elements in the group on the real line, here's zero, here's our smallest element B, which is in H. Here's some other element H, which is in H. We just go marching off here in multiples of B until H is squeezed between two multiples of B, which means that if we subtract that multiple of B from H, the remainder is less than B.

414
34:47,548 --> 34:48,188
Okay?

415
34:48,948 --> 34:52,038
Now, I claim that R is equal to zero.

416
34:52,908 --> 34:53,498
Why?

417
34:56,458 --> 35:02,688
Which will show that H is actually a multiple of B, so that this exhausts the subgroup.

418
35:03,328 --> 35:09,168
And the proof is, if not, why? Because

419
35:10,748 --> 35:14,908
R is actually an element in H.

420
35:15,788 --> 35:16,618
Why?

421
35:16,918 --> 35:31,278
B is an H, so the multiple of B is an H. H is an H. So if I take H and I add to it the inverse of this, I get something in H. H + minus MB is in H.

422
35:31,548 --> 35:34,118
by the fact that H is closed under inversion and addition.

423
35:34,508 --> 35:37,838
But H + - MB is R.

424
35:38,478 --> 35:41,678
R was assumed to be a positive number less than B.

425
35:42,618 --> 35:46,178
B was assumed to be the smallest positive number in H.

426
35:46,508 --> 35:50,328
So the only way this can be the case is if the remainder is zero.

427
35:51,328 --> 35:59,688
So R is equal to zero, which says that everything in H is a multiple of B. Okay?

428
36:00,498 --> 36:09,658
So this is a nice application of the Euclidean algorithm, which is used to prove the existence of greatest common divisors and unique prime factorization in Euclid.

429
36:09,658 --> 36:18,848
But it also establishes, Artin shows you is a slightly more sophisticated algebraic fact that it allows you to identify all subgroups of Z with the multiples of a fixed number.

430
36:19,138 --> 36:21,938
And any multiple of a fixed number gives you a subgroup.

431
36:22,748 --> 36:23,478
Good?

432
36:24,058 --> 36:28,588
So there are an infinite number of subgroups of Z, and uh there they are.

433
36:29,238 --> 36:34,558
Let me just end with one more definition, and then Peter will pick up with this on Friday.

434
36:34,888 --> 36:40,448
So you get to see him lecture before you commit yourself irrevocably to this course.

435
36:41,218 --> 36:41,908
Okay.

436
36:42,638 --> 36:43,328
Okay.

437
36:48,238 --> 36:59,488
So, I want to talk about a certain type of subgroup that you get. So if you have any group G, any group, and you have an element G and G,

438
37:00,398 --> 37:16,898
there's a natural subgroup that I'll denote by H, which I'll write like this, which is sometimes called the cyclic subgroup generated by Z uh G

439
37:17,348 --> 37:24,548
which is consists of all products of G with itself. It's the smallest subgroup that could contain this element.

440
37:25,478 --> 37:26,058
Okay?

441
37:26,618 --> 37:47,518
So it consists of things like E g, since it has g in it, it has to have g inverse in it, then it has to have g squared in it, then it has to have g the minus 2. So it consists of all powers of g.

442
37:48,158 --> 37:50,828
Okay.

443
37:52,338 --> 37:56,058
where the zeroth power is defined to be the identity.

444
37:56,058 --> 38:08,328
Because if you if you have the element G in it, you certainly have to have all powers of G in it. If it's closed under multiplication and inversion. Moreover, once you get all powers of G in it, then um

445
38:09,318 --> 38:18,708
it's certainly closed under multiplication. You multiply two powers of G, you get another. I mean, the power law works in a group just like it does in normal arithmetic.

446
38:18,988 --> 38:27,758
Because this just means the product of G with itself M times, and this means the product of G with itself n times. So when you take the whole product, you have the product of G with itself m plus n times.

447
38:28,188 --> 38:34,068
The inverse of G to the M is G to the minus M. And that's contained in here.

448
38:35,128 --> 38:42,288
Okay? So this is certainly closed under addition and an inversion contains the identity element. So there it is. There's the cyclic subgroup.

449
38:42,288 --> 38:48,098
However, and this is a big caveat, don't necessarily think that those powers are distinct.

450
38:48,778 --> 38:54,488
And there could be a point where you take the power and you get back to the identity element.

451
38:54,798 --> 39:03,038
We saw that in the symmetric group. In the in S3, we had this element Tau with the property that Tau squared was the identity element.

452
39:03,718 --> 39:11,168
So if we took the cyclic subgroup generated by Tau in S3, it would just be the group E Tau.

453
39:11,898 --> 39:14,928
It would be that subgroup of order two.

454
39:15,938 --> 39:22,728
So that's a big question, namely, what do you get to a power of G where it becomes the identity element or not?

455
39:23,118 --> 39:46,788
So if G to the M is equal to the identity and M is the smallest power, smallest positive such power, we say M is the order of G in G.

456
39:47,758 --> 40:04,648
And if if no power g to the M equals the identity smallest positive such power for M greater than zero, we say g has infinite order.

457
40:05,888 --> 40:08,948
Okay. So the elements in Z...

458
40:10,478 --> 40:16,988
all have infinite order except for zero which has order one. Once you get to a positive integer,

459
40:17,478 --> 40:24,278
no matter how many times you add it to itself, you never get back to the identity because you keep marching out.

460
40:24,788 --> 40:31,218
But in the symmetric group on three letters, we find that this Tau has order two.

461
40:32,028 --> 40:38,468
Someone has a phone call. And then we find that Sigma, if you cube it, you get to the identity has order three.

462
40:39,088 --> 40:40,658
Okay.

463
40:42,108 --> 40:44,288
Is that signify the class is over?

464
40:44,288 --> 40:55,088
All right, we're going to find a big theorem, big theorem what's coming up is that in a finite group, every element has finite order and the order divides the order of the group.

465
40:55,088 --> 41:00,898
So here we got order two and three. Huh, they both divide six. Big theorem.

466
41:02,138 --> 41:08,008
In an infinite group, elements can either have finite or infinite order. Peter will give you examples of that next time. Okay.

467
41:09,098 --> 41:09,408
Okay.
