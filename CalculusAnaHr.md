32. What is wrong with the following proof: Let x = y. Then $x^2 = xy$. Subtract $y^2$ from both sides: $x^2 - y^2 = xy - y^2$. Factor both sides: $(x+y)(x-y) = y(x-y)$. Divide both sides by $(x-y)$: $x+y = y$. Since x = y, substitute x for y: $y+y = y$, so $2y = y$. Divide by y: $2 = 1$.
    A.  Factoring $x^2 - y^2$ is not allowed.
    B.  Cannot substitute x for y in the step $x+y = y$.
    C.  Dividing by y in the last step is not allowed.

36. Consider lim (x²) = 4 as x→2. If ε = 0.1, find a δ such that if 0 < |x - 2| < δ, then |x² - 4| < 0.1. (You may use the text's method: first restrict |x-2|<1).
